On Nihilism \\n\\n\\nTHE PRECESSION OF SIMULACRA \\n\\n\\nThe simulacrum is never what hides the truth - it is truth that hides the fact that \\nthere is none. \\n\\nThe simulacrum is true. \\n\\n\\n-Ecclesiastes \\n\\n\\nIf once we were able to view the Borges fable in which the cartographers of the Empire \\ndraw up a map so detailed that it ends up covering the territory exactly (the decline of the \\nEmpire witnesses the fraying of this map, little by little, and its fall into ruins, though \\nsome shreds are still discernible in the deserts - the metaphysical beauty of this ruined \\nabstraction testifying to a pride equal to the Empire and rotting like a carcass, returning \\nto the substance of the soil, a bit as the double ends by being confused with the real \\nthrough aging) - as the most beautiful allegory of simulation, this fable has now come full \\ncircle for us, and possesses nothing but the discrete charm of second-order simulacra.*l \\n\\nToday abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. \\nSimulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance. It is the \\ngeneration by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal. The territory no \\nlonger precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless the map that precedes \\nthe territory - precession of simulacra - that engenders the territory, and if one must \\nreturn to the fable, today it is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the extent of \\nthe map. It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the \\ndeserts that are no longer those of the Empire, but ours. The desert of the real itself. \\n\\nIn fact, even inverted, Borges\\'s fable is unusable. Only the allegory of the Empire, \\nperhaps, remains. Because it is with this same imperialism that present-day simulators \\nattempt to make the real, all of the real, coincide with their models of simulation. But it is \\nno longer a question of either maps or territories. Something has disappeared: the \\nsovereign difference, between one and the other, that constituted the charm of \\nabstraction. Because it is difference that constitutes the poetry of the map and the charm \\nof the territory, the magic of the concept and the charm of the real. This imaginary of \\nrepresentation, which simultaneously culminates in and is engulfed by the cartographers \\nmad project of the ideal coextensivity of map and territory, disappears in the simulation \\nwhose operation is nuclear and genetic, no longer at all specular or discursive. It is all of \\nmetaphysics that is lost. No more mirror of being and appearances, of the real and its \\nconcept. No more imaginary coextensivity: it is genetic miniaturization that is the \\ndimension of simulation. The real is produced from miniaturized cells, matrices, and \\nmemory banks, models of control - and it can be reproduced an indefinite number of \\ntimes from these. It no longer needs to be rational, because it no longer measures itself \\nagainst either an ideal or negative instance. It is no longer anything but operational. In \\nfact, it is no longer really the real, because no imaginary envelops it anymore. It is a \\nhyperreal, produced from a radiating synthesis of combinatory models in a hyperspace \\nwithout atmosphere. \\n\\nBy crossing into a space whose curvature is no longer that of the real, nor that of truth, \\nthe era of simulation is inaugurated by a liquidation of all referentials - worse: with their \\n\\n\\nartificial resurrection in the systems of signs, a material more malleable than meaning, in \\nthat it lends itself to all systems of equivalences, to all binary oppositions, to all \\ncombinatory algebra. It is no longer a question of imitation, nor duplication, nor even \\nparody. It is a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real, that is to say of an \\noperation of deterring every real process via its operational double, a programmatic, \\nmetastable, perfectly descriptive machine that offers all the signs of the real and short- \\ncircuits all its vicissitudes. Never again will the real have the chance to produce itself - \\nsuch is the vital function of the model in a system of death, or rather of anticipated \\nresurrection, that no longer even gives the event of death a chance. A hyperreal \\nhenceforth sheltered from the imaginary, and from any distinction between the real and \\nthe imaginary, leaving room only for the orbital recurrence of models and for the \\nsimulated generation of differences. \\n\\nTHE DIVINE IRREFERENCE OF IMAGES \\n\\nTo dissimulate is to pretend not to have what one has. To simulate is to feign to have \\nwhat one doesn\\'t have. One implies a presence, the other an absence. But it is more \\ncomplicated than that because simulating is not pretending: \"Whoever fakes an illness \\ncan simply stay in bed and make everyone believe he is ill. Whoever simulates an illness \\nproduces in himself some of the symptoms\" (Littre). Therefore, pretending, or \\ndissimulating, leaves the principle of reality intact: the difference is always clear, it is \\nsimply masked, whereas simulation threatens the difference between the \"true\" and the \\n\"false,\" the \"real\" and the \"imaginary.\" Is the simulator sick or not, given that he \\nproduces \"true\" symptoms? Objectively one cannot treat him as being either ill or not ill. \\nPsychology and medicine stop at this point, forestalled by the illness\\'s henceforth \\nundiscoverable truth. For if any symptom can be \"produced,\" and can no longer be taken \\nas a fact of nature, then every illness can be considered as simulatable and simulated, and \\nmedicine loses its meaning since it only knows how to treat \"real\" illnesses according to \\ntheir objective causes. Psychosomatics evolves in a dubious manner at the borders of the \\nprinciple of illness. As to psychoanalysis, it transfers the symptom of the organic order to \\nthe unconscious order: the latter is new and taken for \"real\" more real than the other - but \\nwhy would simulation be at the gates of the unconscious? Why couldn\\'t the \"work\" of the \\nunconscious be \"produced\" in the same way as any old symptom of classical medicine? \\nDreams already are. \\n\\nCertainly, the psychiatrist purports that \"for every form of mental alienation there is a \\nparticular order in the succession of symptoms of which the simulator is ignorant and in \\nthe absence of which the psychiatrist would not be deceived.\" This (which dates from \\n1865) in order to safeguard the principle of a truth at all costs and to escape the \\ninterrogation posed by simulation - the knowledge that truth, reference, objective cause \\nhave ceased to exist. Now, what can medicine do with what floats on either side of \\nillness, on either side of health, with the duplication of illness in a discourse that is no \\nlonger either true or false? What can psychoanalysis do with the duplication of the \\ndiscourse of the unconscious in the discourse of simulation that can never again be \\nunmasked, since it is not false either?*2 \\n\\n\\nWhat can the army do about simulators? Traditionally it unmasks them and punishes \\n\\n\\n\\nthem, according to a clear principle of identification. Today it can discharge a very good \\nsimulator as exactly equivalent to a \"real\" homosexual, a heart patient, or a madman. \\n\\nEven military psychology draws back from Cartesian certainties and hesitates to make \\nthe distinction between true and false, between the \"produced\" and the authentic \\nsymptom. \"If he is this good at acting crazy, it\\'s because he is.\" Nor is military \\npsychology mistaken in this regard: in this sense, all crazy people simulate, and this lack \\nof distinction is the worst kind of subversion. It is against this lack of distinction that \\nclassical reason armed itself in all its categories. But it is what today again outflanks \\nthem, submerging the principle of truth. \\n\\nBeyond medicine and the army favored terrains of simulation, the question returns to \\nreligion and the simulacrum of divinity: \"I forbade that there be any simulacra in the \\ntemples because the divinity that animates nature can never be represented.\" Indeed it can \\nbe. But what becomes of the divinity when it reveals itself in icons, when it is multiplied \\nin simulacra? Does it remain the supreme power that is simply incarnated in images as a \\nvisible theology? Or does it volatilize itself in the simulacra that, alone, deploy their \\npower and pomp of fascination - the visible machinery of icons substituted for the pure \\nand intelligible Idea of God? This is precisely what was feared by Iconoclasts, whose \\nmillennial quarrel is still with us today.*3 This is precisely because they predicted this \\nomnipotence of simulacra, the faculty simulacra have of effacing God from the \\nconscience of man, and the destructive, annihilating truth that they allow to appear - that \\ndeep down God never existed, that only the simulacrum ever existed, even that God \\nhimself was never anything but his own simulacrum - from this came their urge to \\ndestroy the images. If they could have believed that these images only obfuscated or \\nmasked the Platonic Idea of God, there would have been no reason to destroy them. One \\ncan live with the idea of distorted truth. But their metaphysical despair came from the \\nidea that the image didn\\'t conceal anything at all, and that these images were in essence \\nnot images, such as an original model would have made them, but perfect simulacra, \\nforever radiant with their own fascination. Thus this death of the divine referential must \\nbe exorcised at all costs. \\n\\nOne can see that the iconoclasts, whom one accuses of disdaining and negating images, \\nwere those who accorded them their true value, in contrast to the iconolaters who only \\nsaw reflections in them and were content to venerate a filigree God. On the other hand, \\none can say that the icon worshipers were the most modem minds, the most adventurous, \\nbecause, in the guise of having God become apparent in the mirror of images, they were \\nalready enacting his death and his disappearance in the epiphany of his representations \\n(which, perhaps, they already knew no longer represented anything, that they were purely \\na game, but that it was therein the great game lay - knowing also that it is dangerous to \\nunmask images, since they dissimulate the fact that there is nothing behind them). \\n\\nThis was the approach of the Jesuits, who founded their politics on the virtual \\ndisappearance of God and on the worldly and spectacular manipulation of consciences - \\nthe evanescence of God in the epiphany of power - the end of transcendence, which now \\nonly serves as an alibi for a strategy altogether free of influences and signs. Behind the \\nbaroqueness of images hides the eminence grise of politics. \\n\\n\\nThis way the stake will always have been the murderous power of images, murderers of \\n\\n\\n\\nthe real, murderers of their own model, as the Byzantine icons could be those of divine \\nidentity. To this murderous power is opposed that of representations as a dialectical \\npower, the visible and intelligible mediation of the Real. All Western faith and good faith \\nbecame engaged in this wager on representation: that a sign could refer to the depth of \\nmeaning, that a sign could be exchanged for meaning and that something could guarantee \\nthis exchange - God of course. But what if God himself can be simulated, that is to say \\ncan be reduced to the signs that constitute faith? Then the whole system becomes \\nweightless, it is no longer itself anything but a gigantic simulacrum - not unreal, but a \\nsimulacrum, that is to say never exchanged for the real, but exchanged for itself, in an \\nuninterrupted circuit without reference or circumference. \\n\\nSuch is simulation, insofar as it is opposed to representation. Representation stems from \\nthe principle of the equivalence of the sign and of the real (even if this equivalence is \\nUtopian, it is a fundamental axiom). Simulation, on the contrary, stems from the Utopia \\nof the principle of equivalence, from the radical negation of the sign as value, from the \\nsign as the reversion and death sentence of every reference. Whereas representation \\nattempts to absorb simulation by interpreting it as a false representation, simulation \\nenvelops the whole edifice of representation itself as a simulacrum. \\n\\nSuch would be the successive phases of the image: \\n\\nit is the reflection of a profound reality; \\nit masks and denatures a profound reality; \\nit masks the absence of a profound reality; \\nit has no relation to any reality whatsoever; \\nit is its own pure simulacrum. \\n\\nIn the first case, the image is a good appearance - representation is of the sacramental \\norder. In the second, it is an evil appearance - it is of the order of maleficence. In the \\nthird, it plays at being an appearance - it is of the order of sorcery. In the fourth, it is no \\nlonger of the order of appearances, but of simulation. \\n\\nThe transition from signs that dissimulate something to signs that dissimulate that there is \\nnothing marks a decisive turning point. The first reflects a theology of truth and secrecy \\n(to which the notion of ideology still belongs). The second inaugurates the era of \\nsimulacra and of simulation, in which there is no longer a God to recognize his own, no \\nlonger a Last Judgment to separate the false from the true, the real from its artificial \\nresurrection, as everything is already dead and resurrected in advance. \\n\\nWhen the real is no longer what it was, nostalgia assumes its full meaning. There is a \\nplethora of myths of origin and of signs of reality - a plethora of truth, of secondary \\nobjectivity, and authenticity. Escalation of the true, of lived experience, resurrection of \\nthe figurative where the object and substance have disappeared. Panic-stricken \\nproduction of the real and of the referential, parallel to and greater than the panic of \\nmaterial production: this is how simulation appears in the phase that concerns us - a \\nstrategy of the real, of the neoreal and the hyperreal that everywhere is the double of a \\nstrategy of deterrence. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRAMSES, OR THE ROSY-COLORED RESURRECTION \\n\\n\\nEthnology brushed up against its paradoxical death in 1971, the day when the Philippine \\ngovernment decided to return the few dozen Tasaday who had just been discovered in the \\ndepths of the jungle, where they had lived for eight centuries without any contact with the \\nrest of the species, to their primitive state, out of the reach of colonizers, tourists, and \\nethnologists. This at the suggestion of the anthropologists themselves, who were seeing \\nthe indigenous people disintegrate immediately upon contact, like mummies in the open \\nair. \\n\\nIn order for ethnology to live, its object must die; by dying, the object takes its revenge \\nfor being \"discovered\" and with its death defies the science that wants to grasp it. \\n\\nDoesn\\'t all science live on this paradoxical slope to which it is doomed by the \\nevanescence of its object in its very apprehension, and by the pitiless reversal that the \\ndead object exerts on it? Like Orpheus, it always turns around too soon, and, like \\nEurydice, its object falls back into Hades. \\n\\nIt is against this hell of the paradox that the ethnologists wished to protect themselves by \\ncordoning off the Tasaday with virgin forest. No one can touch them anymore: as in a \\nmine the vein is closed down. Science loses precious capital there, but the object will be \\nsafe, lost to science, but intact in its \"virginity.\" It is not a question of sacrifice (science \\nnever sacrifices itself, it is always murderous), but of the simulated sacrifice of its object \\nin order to save its reality principle. The Tasaday, frozen in their natural element, will \\nprovide a perfect alibi, an eternal guarantee. Here begins an antiethnology that will never \\nend and to which Jaulin, Castaneda, Clastres are various witnesses. In any case, the \\nlogical evolution of a science is to distance itself increasingly from its object, until it \\ndispenses with it entirely: its autonomy is only rendered even more fantastic - it attains its \\npure form. \\n\\nThe Indian thus returned to the ghetto, in the glass coffin of the virgin forest, again \\nbecomes the model of simulation of all the possible Indians from before ethnology. This \\nmodel thus grants itself the luxury to incarnate itself beyond itself in the \"brute\" reality of \\nthese Indians it has entirely reinvented - Savages who are indebted to ethnology for still \\nbeing Savages: what a turn of events, what a triumph for this science that seemed \\ndedicated to their destruction! \\n\\nOf course, these savages are posthumous: frozen, cryogenized, sterilized, protected to \\ndeath, they have become referential simulacra, and science itself has become pure \\nsimulation. The same holds true at Cruesot, at the level of the \"open\" museum where one \\nmuseumified in situ, as \"historical\" witnesses of their period, entire working-class \\nneighborhoods, living metallurgic zones, an entire culture, men, women, and children \\nincluded - gestures, languages, customs fossilized alive as in a snapshot. The museum, \\ninstead of being circumscribed as a geometric site, is everywhere now, like a dimension \\nof life. Thus ethnology, rather than circumscribing itself as an objective science, will \\ntoday, liberated from its object, be applied to all living things and make itself invisible, \\nlike an omnipresent fourth dimension, that of the simulacrum. We are all Tasadays, \\nIndians who have again become what they were - simulacral Indians who at last proclaim \\n\\n\\n\\nthe universal truth of ethnology. \\n\\n\\nWe have all become living specimens in the spectral light of ethnology, or of \\nantiethnology, which is nothing but the pure form of triumphal ethnology, under the sign \\nof dead differences, and of the resurrection of differences. It is thus very naive to look for \\nethnology in the Savages or in some Third World - it is here, everywhere, in the \\nmetropolises, in the White community, in a world completely cataloged and analyzed, \\nthen artificially resurrected under the auspices of the real, in a world of simulation, of the \\nhallucination of truth, of the blackmail of the real, of the murder of every symbolic form \\nand of its hysterical, historical retrospection - a murder of which the Savages, noblesse \\noblige, were the first victims, but that for a long time has extended to all Western \\nsocieties. \\n\\nBut in the same breath ethnology grants us its only and final lesson, the secret that kills it \\n(and which the Savages knew better than it did): the vengeance of the dead. \\n\\nThe confinement of the scientific object is equal to the confinement of the mad and the \\ndead. And just as all of society is irremediably contaminated by this mirror of madness \\nthat it has held up to itself, science can\\'t help but die contaminated by the death of this \\nobject that is its inverse mirror. It is science that masters the objects, but it is the objects \\nthat invest it with depth, according to an unconscious reversion, which only gives a dead \\nand circular response to a dead and circular interrogation. \\n\\nNothing changes when society breaks the mirror of madness (abolishes the asylums, \\ngives speech back to the insane, etc.) nor when science seems to break the mirror of its \\nobjectivity (effacing itself before its object, as in Castaneda, etc.) and to bend down \\nbefore the \"differences.\" The form produced by confinement is followed by an \\ninnumerable, diffracted, slowed-down mechanism. As ethnology collapses in its classical \\ninstitution, it survives in an antiethnology whose task it is to reinject the difference \\nfiction, the Savage fiction everywhere, to conceal that it is this world, ours, which has \\nagain become savage in its way, that is to say, which is devastated by difference and by \\ndeath. \\n\\nIn the same way, with the pretext of saving the original, one forbade visitors to enter the \\nLascaux caves, but an exact replica was constructed five hundred meters from it, so that \\neveryone could see them (one glances through a peephole at the authentic cave, and then \\none visits the reconstituted whole). It is possible that the memory of the original grottoes \\nis itself stamped in the minds of future generations, but from now on there is no longer \\nany difference: the duplication suffices to render both artificial. \\n\\nIn the same way science and technology were recently mobilized to save the mummy of \\nRamses II, after it was left to rot for several dozen years in the depths of a museum. The \\nWest is seized with panic at the thought of not being able to save what the symbolic order \\nhad been able to conserve for forty centuries, but out of sight and far from the light of \\nday. Ramses does not signify anything for us, only the mummy is of an inestimable worth \\nbecause it is what guarantees that accumulation has meaning. Our entire linear and \\naccumulative culture collapses if we cannot stockpile the past in plain view. To this end \\nthe pharaohs must be brought out of their tomb and the mummies out of their silence. To \\n\\n\\n\\nthis end they must be exhumed and given military honors. They are prey to both science \\nand worms. Only absolute secrecy assured them this millennial power - the mastery over \\nputrefaction that signified the mastery of the complete cycle of exchanges with death. We \\nonly know how to place our science in service of repairing the mummy, that is to say \\nrestoring a visible order, whereas embalming was a mythical effort that strove to \\nimmortal i/e a hidden dimension. \\n\\nWe require a visible past, a visible continuum, a visible myth of origin, which reassures \\nus about our end. Because finally we have never believed in them. Whence this historic \\nscene of the reception of the mummy at the Orly airport. Why? Because Ramses was a \\ngreat despotic and military figure? Certainly. But mostly because our culture dreams, \\nbehind this defunct power that it tries to annex, of an order that would have had nothing \\nto do with it, and it dreams of it because it exterminated it by exhuming it as its own past. \\n\\nWe are fascinated by Ramses as Renaissance Christians were by the American Indians, \\nthose (human?) beings who had never known the word of Christ. Thus, at the beginning \\nof colonization, there was a moment of stupor and bewilderment before the very \\npossibility of escaping the universal law of the Gospel. There were two possible \\nresponses: either admit that this Law was not universal, or exterminate the Indians to \\nefface the evidence. In general, one contented oneself with converting them, or even \\nsimply discovering them, which would suffice to slowly exterminate them. \\n\\nThus it would have been enough to exhume Ramses to ensure his extermination by \\nmuseumification. Because mummies don\\'t rot from worms: they die from being \\ntransplanted from a slow order of the symbolic, master over putrefaction and death, to an \\norder of history, science, and museums, our order, which no longer masters anything, \\nwhich only knows how to condemn what preceded it to decay and death and \\nsubsequently to try to revive it with science. Irreparable violence toward all secrets, the \\nviolence of a civilization without secrets, hatred of a whole civilization for its own \\nfoundation. \\n\\nAnd just as with ethnology, which plays at extricating itself from its object to better \\nsecure itself in its pure form, demuseumification is nothing but another spiral in \\nartificiality. Witness the cloister of Saint-Michel de Cuxa, which one will repatriate at \\ngreat cost from the Cloisters in New York to reinstall it in \"its original site.\" And \\neveryone is supposed to applaud this restitution (as they did \"the experimental campaign \\nto take back the sidewalks\" on the Champs Elysees!). Well, if the exportation of the \\ncornices was in effect an arbitrary act, if the Cloisters in New York are an artificial \\nmosaic of all cultures (following a logic of the capitalist centralization of value), their \\nreimportation to the original site is even more artificial: it is a total simulacrum that links \\nup with \"reality\" through a complete circumvolution. \\n\\nThe cloister should have stayed in New York in its simulated environment, which at least \\nfooled no one. Repatriating it is nothing but a supplementary subterfuge, acting as if \\nnothing had happened and indulging in retrospective hallucination. \\n\\nIn the same way, Americans flatter themselves for having brought the population of \\nIndians back to pre-Conquest levels. One effaces everything and starts over. They even \\n\\n\\n\\nflatter themselves for doing better, for exceeding the original number. This is presented \\nas proof of the superiority of civilization: it will produce more Indians than they \\nthemselves were able to do. (With sinister derision, this overproduction is again a means \\nof destroying them: for Indian culture, like all tribal culture, rests on the limitation of the \\ngroup and the refusal of any \"unlimited\" increase, as can be seen in Ishi\\'s case. In this \\nway, their demographic \"promotion\" is just another step toward symbolic extermination.) \\n\\nEverywhere we live in a universe strangely similar to the original - things are doubled by \\ntheir own scenario. But this doubling does not signify, as it did traditionally, the \\nimminence of their death - they are already purged of their death, and better than when \\nthey were alive; more cheerful, more authentic, in the light of their model, like the faces \\nin funeral homes. \\n\\nTHE HYPERREAL AND THE IMAGINARY \\n\\nDisneyland is a perfect model of all the entangled orders of simulacra. It is first of all a \\nplay of illusions and phantasms: the Pirates, the Frontier, the Future World, etc. This \\nimaginary world is supposed to ensure the success of the operation. But what attracts the \\ncrowds the most is without a doubt the social microcosm, the religious, miniaturized \\npleasure of real America, of its constraints and joys. One parks outside and stands in line \\ninside, one is altogether abandoned at the exit. The only phantasmagoria in this \\nimaginary world lies in the tenderness and warmth of the crowd, and in the sufficient and \\nexcessive number of gadgets necessary to create the multitudinous effect. The contrast \\nwith the absolute solitude of the parking lot - a veritable concentration camp - is total. Or, \\nrather: inside, a whole panoply of gadgets magnetizes the crowd in directed flows - \\noutside, solitude is directed at a single gadget: the automobile. By an extraordinary \\ncoincidence (but this derives without a doubt from the enchantment inherent to this \\nuniverse), this frozen, childlike world is found to have been conceived and realized by a \\nman who is himself now cryogenized: Walt Disney, who awaits his resurrection through \\nan increase of 180 degrees centigrade. \\n\\nThus, everywhere in Disneyland the objective profile of America, down to the \\nmorphology of individuals and of the crowd, is drawn. All its values are exalted by the \\nminiature and the comic strip. Embalmed and pacified. Whence the possibility of an \\nideological analysis of Disneyland (L. Marin did it very well in Utopiques, jeux d\\'espace \\n[Utopias, play of space]): digest of the American way of life, panegyric of American \\nvalues, idealized transposition of a contradictory reality. Certainly. But this masks \\nsomething else and this \"ideological\" blanket functions as a cover for a simulation of the \\nthird order: Disneyland exists in order to hide that it is the \"real\" country, all of \"real\" \\nAmerica that is Disneyland (a bit like prisons are there to hide that it is the social in its \\nentirety, in its banal omnipresence, that is carceral). Disneyland is presented as imaginary \\nin order to make us believe that the rest is real, whereas all of Los Angeles and the \\nAmerica that surrounds it are no longer real, but belong to the hyperreal order and to the \\norder of simulation. It is no longer a question of a false representation of reality \\n(ideology) but of concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the \\nreality principle. \\n\\n\\nThe imaginary of Disneyland is neither true nor false, it is a deterrence machine set up in \\n\\n\\n\\norder to rejuvenate the fiction of the real in the opposite camp. Whence the debility of \\nthis imaginary, its infantile degeneration. This world wants to be childish in order to \\nmake us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the \"real\" world, and to conceal the fact \\nthat true childishness is everywhere - that it is that of the adults themselves who come \\nhere to act the child in order to foster illusions as to their real childishness. \\n\\nDisneyland is not the only one, however. Enchanted Village, Magic Mountain, Marine \\nWorld: Los Angeles is surrounded by these imaginary stations that feed reality, the \\nenergy of the real to a city whose mystery is precisely that of no longer being anything \\nbut a network of incessant, unreal circulation - a city of incredible proportions but \\nwithout space, without dimension. As much as electrical and atomic power stations, as \\nmuch as cinema studios, this city, which is no longer anything but an immense scenario \\nand a perpetual pan shot, needs this old imaginary like a sympathetic nervous system \\nmade up of childhood signals and faked phantasms. \\n\\nDisneyland: a space of the regeneration of the imaginary as waste-treatment plants are \\nelsewhere, and even here. Everywhere today one must recycle waste, and the dreams, the \\nphantasms, the historical, fairylike, legendary imaginary of children and adults is a waste \\nproduct, the first great toxic excrement of a hyperreal civilization. On a mental level, \\nDisneyland is the prototype of this new function. But all the sexual, psychic, somatic \\nrecycling institutes, which proliferate in California, belong to the same order. People no \\nlonger look at each other, but there are institutes for that. They no longer touch each \\nother, but there is contactotherapy. They no longer walk, but they go jogging, etc. \\nEverywhere one recycles lost faculties, or lost bodies, or lost sociality, or the lost taste \\nfor food. One reinvents penury, asceticism, vanished savage naturalness: natural food, \\nhealth food, yoga. Marshall Sahlins\\'s idea that it is the economy of the market, and not of \\nnature at all, that secretes penury, is verified, but at a secondary level: here, in the \\nsophisticated confines of a triumphal market economy is reinvented a penury/sign, a \\npenury/simulacrum, a simulated behavior of the underdeveloped (including the adoption \\nof Marxist tenets) that, in the guise of ecology, of energy crises and the critique of \\ncapital, adds a final esoteric aureole to the triumph of an esoteric culture. Nevertheless, \\nmaybe a mental catastrophe, a mental implosion and involution without precedent lies in \\nwait for a system of this kind, whose visible signs would be those of this strange obesity, \\nor the incredible coexistence of the most bizarre theories and practices, which correspond \\nto the improbable coalition of luxury, heaven, and money, to the improbable luxurious \\nmaterialization of life and to undiscoverable contradictions. \\n\\nPOLITICAL INCANTATION \\n\\nWatergate. The same scenario as in Disneyland (effect of the imaginary concealing that \\nreality no more exists outside than inside the limits of the artificial perimeter): here the \\nscandal effect hiding that there is no difference between the facts and their denunciation \\n(identical methods on the part of the CIA and of the Washington Post journalists). Same \\noperation, tending to regenerate through scandal a moral and political principle, through \\nthe imaginary, a sinking reality principle. \\n\\nThe denunciation of scandal is always an homage to the law. And Watergate in particular \\nsucceeded in imposing the idea that Watergate was a scandal - in this sense it was a \\n\\n\\n\\nprodigious operation of intoxication. A large dose of political morality reinjected on a \\nworld scale. One could say along with Bourdieu: \"The essence of every relation of force \\nis to dissimulate itself as such and to acquire all its force only because it dissimulates \\nitself as such,\" understood as follows: capital, immoral and without scruples, can only \\nfunction behind a moral superstructure, and whoever revives this public morality \\n(through indignation, denunciation, etc.) works spontaneously for the order of capital. \\nThis is what the journalists of the Washington Post did. \\n\\nBut this would be nothing but the formula of ideology, and when Bourdieu states it, he \\ntakes the \"relation of force\" for the truth of capitalist domination, and he himself \\ndenounces this relation of force as scandal - he is thus in the same deterministic and \\nmoralistic position as the Washington Post journalists are. He does the same work of \\npurging and reviving moral order, an order of truth in which the veritable symbolic \\nviolence of the social order is engendered, well beyond all the relations of force, which \\nare only its shifting and indifferent configuration in the moral and political consciences \\nof men. \\n\\nAll that capital asks of us is to receive it as rational or to combat it in the name of \\nrationality, to receive it as moral or to combat it in the name of morality. Because these \\nare the same, which can be thought of in another way: formerly one worked to \\ndissimulate scandal - today one works to conceal that there is none. \\n\\nWatergate is not a scandal, this is what must be said at all costs, because it is what \\neveryone is busy concealing, this dissimulation masking a strengthening of morality, of a \\nmoral panic as one approaches the primitive (mise en) scene of capital: its instantaneous \\ncruelty, its incomprehensible ferocity, its fundamental immorality - that is what is \\nscandalous, unacceptable to the system of moral and economic equivalence that is the \\naxiom of leftist thought, from the theories of the Enlightenment up to Communism. One \\nimputes this thinking to the contract of capital, but it doesn\\'t give a damn - it is a \\nmonstrous unprincipled enterprise, nothing more. It is \"enlightened\" thought that seeks to \\ncontrol it by imposing rules on it. And all the recrimination that replaces revolutionary \\nthought today comes back to incriminate capital for not following the rules of the game. \\n\"Power is unjust, its justice is a class justice, capital exploits us, etc.\" - as if capital were \\nlinked by a contract to the society it rules. It is the Left that holds out the mirror of \\nequivalence to capital hoping that it will comply, comply with this phantasmagoria of the \\nsocial contract and fulfill its obligations to the whole of society (by the same token, no \\nneed for revolution: it suffices that capital accommodate itself to the rational formula of \\nexchange). \\n\\nCapital, in fact, was never linked by a contract to the society that it dominates. It is a \\nsorcery of social relations, it is a challenge to society, and it must be responded to as \\nsuch. It is not a scandal to be denounced according to moral or economic rationality, but \\na challenge to take up according to symbolic law. \\n\\nMOBIUS - SPIRALING NEGATIVETY \\n\\nWatergate was thus nothing but a lure held out by the system to catch its adversaries - a \\nsimulation of scandal for regenerative ends. In the film, this is embodied by the character \\n\\n\\n\\nof \"Deep Throat,\" who was said to be the eminence grise of the Republicans, \\nmanipulating the left-wing journalists in order to get rid of Nixon - and why not? All \\nhypotheses are possible, but this one is superfluous: the Left itself does a perfectly good \\njob, and spontaneously, of doing the work of the Right. Besides, it would be naive to see \\nan embittered good conscience at work here. Because manipulation is a wavering \\ncausality in which positivity and negativity are engendered and overlap, in which there is \\nno longer either an active or a passive. It is through the arbitrary cessation of this \\nspiraling causality that a principle of political reality can be saved. It is through the \\nsimulation of a narrow, conventional field of perspective in which the premises and the \\nconsequences of an act or of an event can be calculated, that a political credibility can be \\nmaintained (and of course \"objective\" analysis, the struggle, etc.). If one envisions the \\nentire cycle of any act or event in a system where linear continuity and dialectical \\npolarity no longer exist, in a field unhinged by simulation, all determination evaporates, \\nevery act is terminated at the end of the cycle having benefited everyone and having been \\nscattered in all directions. \\n\\nIs any given bombing in Italy the work of leftist extremists, or extreme-right provocation, \\nor a centrist mise-en-scene to discredit all extreme terrorists and to shore up its own \\nfailing power, or again, is it a police-inspired scenario and a form of blackmail to public \\nsecurity? All of this is simultaneously true, and the search for proof, indeed the \\nobjectivity of the facts does not put an end to this vertigo of interpretation. That is, we are \\nin a logic of simulation, which no longer has anything to do with a logic of facts and an \\norder of reason. Simulation is characterized by a precession of the model, of all the \\nmodels based on the merest fact - the models come first, their circulation, orbital like that \\nof the bomb, constitutes the genuine magnetic field of the event. The facts no longer have \\na specific trajectory, they are born at the intersection of models, a single fact can be \\nengendered by all the models at once. This anticipation, this precession, this short circuit, \\nthis confusion of the fact with its model (no more divergence of meaning, no more \\ndialectical polarity, no more negative electricity, implosion of antagonistic poles), is what \\nallows each time for all possible interpretations, even the most contradictory - all true, in \\nthe sense that their truth is to be exchanged, in the image of the models from which they \\nderive, in a generalized cycle. \\n\\nThe Communists attack the Socialist Party as if they wished to shatter the union of the \\nLeft. They give credence to the idea that these resistances would come from a more \\nradical political need. In fact, it is because they no longer want power. But do they not \\nwant power at this juncture, one unfavorable to the Left in general, or unfavorable to \\nthem within the Union of the Left - or do they no longer want it, by definition? When \\nBerlinguer declares: \"There is no need to be afraid to see the Communists take power in \\nItaly,\" it simultaneously signifies: \\n\\n-: that there is no need to be afraid, since the Communists, if they come to power, will \\nchange nothing of its fundamental capitalist mechanism; \\n\\n-: that there is no risk that they will ever come to power (because they don\\'t want to) - \\nand even if they occupy the seat of power, they will never exercise it except by proxy; \\n\\n-: that in fact, power, genuine power no longer exists, and thus there is no risk whoever \\nseizes power or seizes it again; \\n\\n-: but further: I, Berlinguer, am not afraid to see the Communists take power in Italy - \\nwhich may seem self-evident, but not as much as you might think, because \\n\\n\\n\\nit could mean the opposite (no need for psychoanalysis here): I am afraid to see the \\nCommunists take power (and there are good reasons for that, even for a Communist). \\n\\nAll of this is simultaneously true. It is the secret of a discourse \\n\\nthat is no longer simply ambiguous, as political discourses can be, but that conveys the \\nimpossibility of a determined position of power, the impossibility of a determined \\ndiscursive position. And this logic is neither that of one party nor of another. It traverses \\nall discourses without them wanting it to. \\n\\nWho will unravel this imbroglio? The Gordian knot can at least be cut. The Mobius strip, \\nif one divides it, results in a supplementary spiral without the reversibility of surfaces \\nbeing resolved (here the reversible continuity of hypotheses). Hell of simulation, which is \\nno longer one of torture, but of the subtle, maleficent, elusive twisting of meaning*4 - \\nwhere even the condemned at Burgos are still a gift from Franco to Western democracy, \\nwhich seizes the occasion to regenerate its own flagging humanism and whose indignant \\nprotest in turn consolidates Franco\\'s regime by uniting the Spanish masses against this \\nforeign intervention? Where is the truth of all that, when such collusions admirably knot \\nthemselves together without the knowledge of their authors? \\n\\nConjunction of the system and of its extreme alternative like the two sides of a curved \\nmirror, a \"vicious\" curvature of a political space that is henceforth magnetized, \\ncircularized, reversibilized from the right to the left, a torsion that is like that of the evil \\nspirit of commutation, the whole system, the infinity of capital folded back on its own \\nsurface: transfinite? And is it not the same for desire and the libidinal space? Conjunction \\nof desire and value, of desire and capital. Conjunction of desire and the law, the final \\npleasure as the metamorphosis of the law (which is why it is so widely the order of the \\nday): only capital takes pleasure, said Lyotard, before thinking that we now take pleasure \\nin capital. Overwhelming versatility of desire in Deleuze, an enigmatic reversal that \\nbrings desire \"revolutionary in itself, and as if involuntarily, wanting what it wants,\" to \\ndesire its own repression and to invest in paranoid and fascist systems? A malign torsion \\nthat returns this revolution of desire to the same fundamental ambiguity as the other, the \\nhistorical revolution. \\n\\nAll the referentials combine their discourses in a circular, Mobian compulsion. Not so \\nlong ago, sex and work were fiercely opposed terms; today both are dissolved in the same \\ntype of demand. Formerly the discourse on history derived its power from violently \\nopposing itself to that of nature, the discourse of desire to that of power - today they \\nexchange their signifiers and their scenarios. \\n\\nIt would take too long to traverse the entire range of the operational negativity of all \\nthose scenarios of deterrence, which, like Watergate, try to regenerate a moribund \\nprinciple through simulated scandal, phantasm, and murder - a sort of hormonal treatment \\nthrough negativity and crisis. It is always a question of proving the real through the \\nimaginary, proving truth through scandal, proving the law through transgression, proving \\nwork through striking, proving the system through crisis, and capital through revolution, \\nas it is elsewhere (the Tasaday) of proving ethnology through the dispossession of its \\nobject - without taking into account: \\n\\n\\n\\nthe proof of theater through antitheater; \\n\\nthe proof of art through antiart; \\n\\nthe proof of pedagogy through antipedagogy; \\n\\nthe proof of psychiatry through antipsychiatry, etc. \\n\\nEverything is metamorphosed into its opposite to perpetuate itself in its expurgated form. \\nAll the powers, all the institutions speak of themselves through denial, in order to \\nattempt, by simulating death, to escape their real death throes. Power can stage its own \\nmurder to rediscover a glimmer of existence and legitimacy. Such was the case with \\nsome American presidents: the Kennedys were murdered because they still had a political \\ndimension. The others, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, only had the right to phantom attempts, to \\nsimulated murders. But this aura of an artificial menace was still necessary to conceal \\nthat they were no longer anything but the mannequins of power. Formerly, the king (also \\nthe god) had to die, therein lay his power. Today, he is miserably forced to feign death, in \\norder to preserve the blessing of power. But it is lost. \\n\\nTo seek new blood in its own death, to renew the cycle through the mirror of crisis, \\nnegativity, and antipower: this is the only solution - alibi of every power, of every \\ninstitution attempting to break the vicious circle of its irresponsibility and of its \\nfundamental nonexistence, of its already seen and of its already dead. \\n\\nTHE STRATEGY OF THE REAL \\n\\nThe impossibility of rediscovering an absolute level of the real is of the same order as the \\nimpossibility of staging illusion. Illusion is no longer possible, because the real is no \\nlonger possible. It is the whole political problem of parody, of hypersimulation or \\noffensive simulation, that is posed here. \\n\\nFor example: it would be interesting to see whether the repressive apparatus would not \\nreact more violently to a simulated holdup than to a real holdup. Because the latter does \\nnothing but disturb the order of things, the right to property, whereas the former attacks \\nthe reality principle itself. Transgression and violence are less serious because they only \\ncontest the distribution of the real. Simulation is infinitely more dangerous because it \\nalways leaves open to supposition that, above and beyond its object, law and order \\nthemselves might be nothing but simulation. \\n\\nBut the difficulty is proportional to the danger. How to feign a violation and put it to the \\ntest? Simulate a robbery in a large store: how to persuade security that it is a simulated \\nrobbery? There is no \"objective\" difference: the gestures, the signs are the same as for a \\nreal robbery, the signs do not lean to one side or another. To the established order they \\nare always of the order of the real. \\n\\nOrganize a fake holdup. Verify that your weapons are harmless, and take the most \\ntrustworthy hostage, so that no human life will be in danger (or one lapses into the \\ncriminal). Demand a ransom, and make it so that the operation creates as much \\ncommotion as possible - in short, remain close to the \"truth,\" in order to test the reaction \\nof the apparatus to a perfect simulacrum. You won\\'t be able to do it: the network of \\nartificial signs will become inextricably mixed up with real elements (a policeman will \\n\\n\\n\\nreally fire on sight; a client of the bank will faint and die of a heart attack; one will \\nactually pay you the phony ransom), in short, you will immediately find yourself once \\nagain, without wishing it, in the real, one of whose functions is precisely to devour any \\nattempt at simulation, to reduce everything to the real - that is, to the established order \\nitself, well before institutions and justice come into play. \\n\\nIt is necessary to see in this impossibility of isolating the process of simulation the weight \\nof an order that cannot see and conceive of anything but the real, because it cannot \\nfunction anywhere else. The simulation of an offense, if it is established as such, will \\neither be punished less severely (because it has no \"consequences\") or punished as an \\noffense against the judicial system (for example if one sets in motion a police operation \\n\"for nothing\") - but never as simulation since it is precisely as such that no equivalence \\nwith the real is possible, and hence no repression either. The challenge of simulation is \\nnever admitted by power. How can the simulation of virtue be punished? However, as \\nsuch it is as serious as the simulation of crime. Parody renders submission and \\ntransgression equivalent, and that is the most serious crime, because it cancels out the \\ndifference upon which the law is based. The established order can do nothing against it, \\nbecause the law is a simulacrum of the second order, whereas simulation is of the third \\norder, beyond true and false, beyond equivalences, beyond rational distinctions upon \\nwhich the whole of the social and power depend. Thus, lacking the real, it is there that we \\nmust aim at order. \\n\\nThis is certainly why order always opts for the real. When in doubt, it always prefers this \\nhypothesis (as in the army one prefers to take the simulator for a real madman). But this \\nbecomes more and more difficult, because if it is practically impossible to isolate the \\nprocess of simulation, through the force of inertia of the real that surrounds us, the \\nopposite is also true (and this reversibility itself is part of the apparatus of simulation and \\nthe impotence of power): namely, it is now impossible to isolate the process of the real, \\nor to prove the real. \\n\\nThis is how all the holdups, airplane hijackings, etc. are now in some sense simulation \\nholdups in that they are already inscribed in the decoding and orchestration rituals of the \\nmedia, anticipated in their presentation and their possible consequences. In short, where \\nthey function as a group of signs dedicated exclusively to their recurrence as signs, and \\nno longer at all to their \"real\" end. But this does not make them harmless. On the \\ncontrary, it is as hyperreal events, no longer with a specific content or end, but \\nindefinitely refracted by each other (just like so-called historical events: strikes, \\ndemonstrations, crises, etc.),*5 it is in this sense that they cannot be controlled by an \\norder that can only exert itself on the real and the rational, on causes and ends, a \\nreferential order that can only reign over the referential, a determined power that can only \\nreign over a determined world, but that cannot do anything against this indefinite \\nrecurrence of simulation, against this nebula whose weight no longer obeys the laws of \\ngravitation of the real, power itself ends by being dismantled in this space and becoming \\na simulation of power (disconnected from its ends and its objectives, and dedicated to the \\neffects of power and mass simulation). \\n\\nThe only weapon of power, its only strategy against this defection, is to reinject the real \\nand the referential everywhere, to persuade us of the reality of the social, of the gravity of \\n\\n\\n\\nthe economy and the finalities of production. To this end it prefers the discourse of crisis, \\nbut also, why not? that of desire. \"Take your desires for reality!\" can be understood as the \\nultimate slogan of power since in a nonreferential world, even the confusion of the reality \\nprinciple and the principle of desire is less dangerous than contagious hyperreality. One \\nremains among principles, and among those power is always in the right. \\n\\nHyperreality and simulation are deterrents of every principle and every objective, they \\nturn against power the deterrent that it used so well for such a long time. Because in the \\nend, throughout its history it was capital that first fed on the destructuration of every \\nreferential, of every human objective, that shattered every ideal distinction between true \\nand false, good and evil, in order to establish a radical law of equivalence and exchange, \\nthe iron law of its power. Capital was the first to play at deterrence, abstraction, \\ndisconnection, deterritorialization, etc., and if it is the one that fostered reality, the reality \\nprinciple, it was also the first to liquidate it by exterminating all use value, all real \\nequivalence of production and wealth, in the very sense we have of the unreality of the \\nstakes and the omnipotence of manipulation. Well, today it is this same logic that is even \\nmore set against capital. And as soon as it wishes to combat this disastrous spiral by \\nsecreting a last glimmer of reality, on which to establish a last glimmer of power, it does \\nnothing but multiply the signs and accelerate the play of simulation. \\n\\nAs long as the historical threat came at it from the real, power played at deterrence and \\nsimulation, disintegrating all the contradictions by dint of producing equivalent signs. \\nToday when the danger comes at it from simulation (that of being dissolved in the play of \\nsigns), power plays at the real, plays at crisis, plays at remanufacturing artificial, social, \\neconomic, and political stakes. For power, it is a question of life and death. But it is too \\nlate. \\n\\nWhence the characteristic hysteria of our times: that of the production and reproduction \\nof the real. The other production, that of values and commodities, that of the belle epoque \\nof political economy, has for a long time had no specific meaning. What every society \\nlooks for in continuing to produce, and to overproduce, is to restore the real that escapes \\nit. That is why today this \"material\" production is that of the hyperreal itself. It retains all \\nthe features, the whole discourse of traditional production, but it is no longer anything but \\nits scaled-down refraction (thus hyper-realists fix a real from which all meaning and \\ncharm, all depth and energy of representation have vanished in a hallucinatory \\nresemblance). Thus everywhere the hyperrealism of simulation is translated by the \\nhallucinatory resemblance of the real to itself. \\n\\nPower itself has for a long time produced nothing but the signs of its resemblance. And at \\nthe same time, another figure of power comes into play: that of a collective demand for \\nsigns of power - a holy union that is reconstructed around its disappearance. The whole \\nworld adheres to it more or less in terror of the collapse of the political. And in the end \\nthe game of power becomes nothing but the critical obsession with power - obsession \\nwith its death, obsession with its survival, which increases as it disappears. When it has \\ntotally disappeared, we will logically be under the total hallucination of power - a \\nhaunting memory that is already in evidence everywhere, expressing at once the \\ncompulsion to get rid of it (no one wants it anymore, everyone unloads it on everyone \\nelse) and the panicked nostalgia over its loss. The melancholy of societies without power: \\n\\n\\n\\nthis has already stirred up fascism, that overdose of a strong referential in a society that \\ncannot terminate its mourning. \\n\\nWith the extenuation of the political sphere, the president comes increasingly to resemble \\nthat Puppet of Power who is the head of primitive societies (Clastres). \\n\\nAll previous presidents pay for and continue to pay for Kennedy\\'s murder as if they were \\nthe ones who had suppressed it - which is true phantasmatically, if not in fact. They must \\nefface this defect and this complicity with their simulated murder. Because, now it can \\nonly be simulated. Presidents Johnson and Ford were both the object of failed \\nassassination attempts which, they were not staged, were at least perpetrated by \\nsimulation. The Kennedys died because they incarnated something: the political, political \\nsubstance, whereas the new presidents are nothing but caricatures and fake film - \\ncuriously, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, all have this simian mug, the monkeys of power. \\n\\nDeath is never an absolute criterion, but in this case it is significant: the era of James \\nDean, Marilyn Monroe, and the Kennedys, of those who really died simply because they \\nhad a mythic dimension that implies death (not for romantic reasons, but because of the \\nfundamental principle of reversal and exchange) - this era is long gone. It is now the era \\nof murder by simulation, of the generalized aesthetic of simulation, of the murder-alibi - \\nthe allegorical resurrection of death, which is only there to sanction the institution of \\npower, without which it no longer has any substance or an autonomous reality. \\n\\nThese staged presidential assassinations are revealing because they signal the status of all \\nnegativity in the West: political opposition, the \"Left,\" critical discourse, etc. - a \\nsimulacral contrast through which power attempts to break the vicious circle of its \\nnonexistence, of its fundamental irresponsibility, of its \"suspension.\" Power floats like \\nmoney, like language, like theory. Criticism and negativity alone still secrete a phantom \\nof the reality of power. If they become weak for one reason or another, power has no \\nother recourse but to artificially revive and hallucinate them. \\n\\nIt is in this way that the Spanish executions still serve as a stimulant to Western liberal \\ndemocracy, to a dying system of democratic values. Fresh blood, but for how much \\nlonger? The deterioration of all power is irresistibly pursued: it is not so much the \\n\"revolutionary forces\" that accelerate this process (often it is quite the opposite), it is the \\nsystem itself that deploys against its own structures this violence that annuls all substance \\nand all finality. One must not resist this process by trying to confront the system and \\ndestroy it, because this system that is dying from being dispossessed of its death expects \\nnothing but that from us: that we give the system back its death, that we revive it through \\nthe negative. End of revolutionary praxis, end of the dialectic. Curiously, Nixon, who \\nwas not even found worthy of dying at the hands of the most insignificant, chance, \\nunbalanced person (and though it is perhaps true that presidents are assassinated by \\nunbalanced types, this changes nothing: the leftist penchant for detecting a rightist \\nconspiracy beneath this brings out a false problem - the function of bringing death to, or \\nthe prophecy, etc., against power has always been fulfilled, from primitive societies to \\nthe present, by demented people, crazy people, or neurotics, who nonetheless carry out a \\nsocial function as fundamental as that of presidents), was nevertheless ritually put to \\ndeath by Watergate. Watergate is still a mechanism for the ritual murder of power (the \\n\\n\\n\\nAmerican institution of the presidency is much more thrilling in this regard than the \\nEuropean: it surrounds itself with all the violence and vicissitudes of primitive powers, of \\nsavage rituals). But already impeachment is no longer assassination: it happens via the \\nConstitution. Nixon has nevertheless arrived at the goal of which all power dreams: to be \\ntaken seriously enough, to constitute a mortal enough danger to the group to be one day \\nrelieved of his duties, denounced, and liquidated. Ford doesn\\'t even have this opportunity \\nanymore: a simulacrum of an already dead power, he can only accumulate against \\nhimself the signs of reversion through murder - in fact, he is immunized by his \\nimpotence, which infuriates him. \\n\\nIn contrast to the primitive rite, which foresees the official and sacrificial death of the \\nking (the king or the chief is nothing without the promise of his sacrifice), the modern \\npolitical imaginary goes increasingly in the direction of delaying, of concealing for as \\nlong as possible, the death of the head of state. This obsession has accumulated since the \\nera of revolutions and of charismatic leaders: Hitler, Franco, Mao, having no \\n\"legitimate\" heirs, no filiation of power, see themselves forced to perpetuate themselves \\nindefinitely - popular myth never wishes to believe them dead. The pharaohs already did \\nthis: it was always one and the same person who incarnated the successive pharaohs. \\n\\nEverything happens as if Mao or Franco had already died several times and had been \\nreplaced by his double. From a political point of view, that a head of state remains the \\nsame or is someone else doesn\\'t strictly change anything, so long as they resemble each \\nother. For a long time now a head of state - no matter which one - is nothing but the \\nsimulacrum of himself, and only that gives him the power and the quality to govern. No \\none would grant the least consent, the least devotion to a real person. It is to his double, \\nhe being always already dead, to which allegiance is given. This myth does nothing but \\ntranslate the persistence, and at the same time the deception, of the necessity of the king\\'s \\nsacrificial death. \\n\\nWe are still in the same boat: no society knows how to mourn the real, power, the social \\nitself, which is implicated in the same loss. And it is through an artificial revitalization of \\nall this that we try to escape this fact. This situation will no doubt end up giving rise to \\nsocialism. Through an unforeseen turn of events and via an irony that is no longer that of \\nhistory, it is from the death of the social that socialism will emerge, as it is from the death \\nof God that religions emerge. A twisted advent, a perverse event, an unintelligible \\nreversion to the logic of reason. As is the fact that power is in essence no longer present \\nexcept to conceal that there is no more power. A simulation that can last indefinitely, \\nbecause, as distinct from \"true\" power - which is, or was, a structure, a strategy, a relation \\nof force, a stake - it is nothing but the object of a social demand, and thus as the object of \\nthe law of supply and demand, it is no longer subject to violence and death. Completely \\npurged of a political dimension, it, like any other commodity, is dependent on mass \\nproduction and consumption. Its spark has disappeared, only the fiction of a political \\nuniverse remains. \\n\\nThe same holds true for work. The spark of production, the violence of its stakes no \\nlonger exist. The whole world still produces, and increasingly, but subtly work has \\nbecome something else: a need (as Marx ideally envisioned it but not in the same sense), \\nthe object of a social \"demand,\" like leisure, to which it is equivalent in the course of \\n\\n\\n\\neveryday life. A demand exactly proportional to the loss of a stake in the work process.*6 \\nSame change in fortune as for power: the scenario of work is there to conceal that the real \\nof work, the real of production, has disappeared. And the real of the strike as well, which \\nis no longer a work stoppage, but its alternate pole in the ritual scansion of the social \\ncalendar. Everything occurs as if each person had, after declaring a strike, \"occupied\" his \\nplace and work station and recommenced production, as is the norm in a \"self-managed\" \\noccupation, exactly in the same terms as before, all while declaring himself (and in \\nvirtually being) permanently on strike. \\n\\nThis is not a dream out of science fiction: everywhere it is a question of doubling the \\nprocess of work. And of a doubling of the process of going on strike - striking \\nincorporated just as obsolescence is in objects, just as crisis is in production. So, there is \\nno longer striking, nor work, but both simultaneously, that is to say something else: a \\nmagic of work, a trompel\\'oeil, a scenodrama (so as not to say a melodrama) of \\nproduction, a collective dramaturgy on the empty stage of the social. \\n\\nIt is no longer a question of the ideology of work - the traditional ethic that would \\nobscure the \"real\" process of work and the \"objective\" process of exploitation - but of the \\nscenario of work. In the same way, it is no longer a question of the ideology of power, \\nbut of the scenario of power. Ideology only corresponds to a corruption of reality through \\nsigns; simulation corresponds to a short circuit of reality and to its duplication through \\nsigns. It is always the goal of the ideological analysis to restore the objective process, it is \\nalways a false problem to wish to restore the truth beneath the simulacrum. \\n\\nThis is why in the end power is so much in tune with ideological discourses and \\ndiscourses on ideology, that is they are discourses of truth - always good for countering \\nthe mortal blows of simulation, even and especially if they are revolutionary. \\n\\nTHE END OF THE PANOPTICON \\n\\nIt is still to this ideology of lived experience - exhumation of the real in its fundamental \\nbanality, in its radical authenticity - that the American TV verite experiment attempted on \\nthe Loud family in 1971 refers: seven months of uninterrupted shooting, three hundred \\nhours of nonstop broadcasting, without a script or a screenplay, the odyssey of a family, \\nits dramas, its joys, its unexpected events, nonstop - in short, a \"raw\" historical \\ndocument, and the \"greatest television performance, comparable, on the scale of our day- \\nto-day life, to the footage of our landing on the moon.\" It becomes more complicated \\nbecause this family fell apart during the filming: a crisis erupted, the Louds separated, \\netc. Whence that insoluble controversy: was TV itself responsible? What would have \\nhappened if TV hadn\\'t been there? \\n\\nMore interesting is the illusion of filming the Louds as if TV weren\\'t there. The \\nproducer\\'s triumph was to say: \"They lived as if we were not there.\" An absurd, \\nparadoxical formula - neither true nor false: Utopian. The \"as if we were not there\" being \\nequal to \"as if you were there.\" It is this Utopia, this paradox that fascinated the twenty \\nmillion viewers, much more than did the \"perverse\" pleasure of violating someone\\'s \\nprivacy. In the \"verite\" experience it is not a question of secrecy or perversion, but of a \\nsort of frisson of the real, or of an aesthetics of the hyperreal, a frisson of vertiginous and \\n\\n\\n\\nphony exactitude, a frisson of simultaneous distancing and magnification, of distortion of \\nscale, of an excessive transparency. The pleasure of an excess of meaning, when the bar \\nof the sign falls below the usual waterline of meaning: the nonsignifier is exalted by the \\ncamera angle. There one sees what the real never was (but \"as if you were there\"), \\nwithout the distance that gives us perspectival space and depth vision (but \"more real \\nthan nature\"). Pleasure in the microscopic simulation that allows the real to pass into the \\nhyperreal. (This is also somewhat the case in porno, which is fascinating more on a \\nmetaphysical than on a sexual level.) \\n\\nBesides, this family was already hyperreal by the very nature of its selection: a typical \\nideal American family, California home, three garages, five children, assured social and \\nprofessional status, decorative housewife, upper-middle-class standing. In a way it is this \\nstatistical perfection that dooms it to death. Ideal heroine of the American way of life, it \\nis, as in ancient sacrifices, chosen in order to be glorified and to die beneath the flames of \\nthe medium, a modern fatum. Because heavenly fire no longer falls on corrupted cities, it \\nis the camera lens that, like a laser, comes to pierce lived reality in order to put it to \\ndeath. \"The Louds: simply a family who agreed to deliver themselves into the hands of \\ntelevision, and to die by it,\" the director will say. Thus it is a question of a sacrificial \\nprocess, of a sacrificial spectacle offered to twenty million Americans. The liturgical \\ndrama of a mass society. \\n\\nTV verite. A term admirable in its ambiguity, does it refer to the truth of this family or to \\nthe truth of TV? In fact, it is TV that is the truth of the Louds, it is TV that is true, it is \\nTV that renders true. Truth that is no longer the reflexive truth of the mirror, nor the \\nperspectival truth of the panoptic system and of the gaze, but the manipulative truth of \\nthe test that sounds out and interrogates, of the laser that touches and pierces, of \\ncomputer cards that retain your preferred sequences, of the genetic code that controls \\nyour combinations, of cells that inform your sensory universe. It is to this truth that the \\nLoud family was subjected by the medium of TV, and in this sense it amounts to a death \\nsentence (but is it still a question of truth?). \\n\\nEnd of the panoptic system. The eye of TV is no longer the source of an absolute gaze, \\nand the ideal of control is no longer that of transparency. This still presupposes an \\nobjective space (that of the Renaissance) and the omnipotence of the despotic gaze. It is \\nstill, if not a system of confinement, at least a system of mapping. More subtly, but \\nalways externally, playing on the opposition of seeing and being seen, even if the \\npanoptic focal point may be blind. \\n\\nSomething else in regard to the Louds. \"You no longer watch TV, it is TV that watches \\nyou (live),\" or again: \"You are no longer listening to Don\\'t Panic, it is Don\\'t Panic that is \\nlistening to you\" - a switch from the panoptic mechanism of surveillance (Discipline and \\nPunish [Surveiller et punir]) to a system of deterrence, in which the distinction between \\nthe passive and the active is abolished. There is no longer any imperative of submission \\nto the model, or to the gaze \"YOU are the model!\" \"YOU are the majority!\" Such is the \\nwatershed of a hyperreal sociality, in which the real is confused with the model, as in the \\nstatistical operation, or with the medium, as in the Louds\\' operation. Such is the last stage \\nof the social relation, ours, which is no longer one of persuasion (the classical age of \\npropaganda, of ideology, of publicity, etc.) but one of deterrence: \"YOU are information, \\n\\n\\n\\nyou are the social, you are the event, you are involved, you have the word, etc.\" An \\nabout-face through which it becomes impossible to locate one instance of the model, of \\npower, of the gaze, of the medium itself, because you are always already on the other \\nside. No more subject, no more focal point, no more center or periphery: pure flexion or \\ncircular inflexion. No more violence or surveillance: only \"information,\" secret virulence, \\nchain reaction, slow implosion, and simulacra of spaces in which the effect of the real \\nagain comes into play. \\n\\nWe are witnessing the end of perspectival and panoptic space (which remains a moral \\nhypothesis bound up with all the classical analyses on the \"objective\" essence of power), \\nand thus to the very abolition of the spectacular. Television, for example in the case of \\nthe Louds, is no longer a spectacular medium. We are no longer in the society of the \\nspectacle, of which the situationists spoke, nor in the specific kinds of alienation and \\nrepression that it implied. The medium itself is no longer identifiable as such, and the \\nconfusion of the medium and the message (McLuhan)*7 is the first great formula of this \\nnew era. There is no longer a medium in the literal sense: it is now intangible, diffused, \\nand diffracted in the real, and one can no longer even say that the medium is altered by it. \\n\\nSuch a blending, such a viral, endemic, chronic, alarming presence of the medium, \\nwithout the possibility of isolating the effects - spectralized, like these advertising laser \\nsculptures in the empty space of the event filtered by the medium - dissolution of TV in \\nlife, dissolution of life in TV - indiscernible chemical solution: we are all Louds doomed \\nnot to invasion, to pressure, to violence and blackmail by the media and the models, but \\nto their induction, to their infiltration, to their illegible violence. \\n\\nBut one must watch out for the negative turn that discourse imposes: it is a question \\nneither of disease nor of a viral infection. One must think instead of the media as if they \\nwere, in outer orbit, a kind of genetic code that directs the mutation of the real into the \\nhyperreal, just as the other micromolecular code controls the passage from a \\nrepresentative sphere of meaning to the genetic one of the programmed signal. \\n\\nIt is the whole traditional world of causality that is in question: the perspectival, \\ndeterminist mode, the \"active,\" critical mode, the analytic mode - the distinction between \\ncause and effect, between active and passive, between subject and object, between the \\nend and the means. It is in this sense that one can say: TV is watching us, TV alienates \\nus, TV manipulates us, TV informs us ... In all this, one remains dependent on the \\nanalytical conception of the media, on an external active and effective agent, on \\n\"perspectival\" information with the horizon of the real and of meaning as the vanishing \\npoint. \\n\\nNow, one must conceive of TV along the lines of DNA as an effect in which the \\nopposing poles of determination vanish, according to a nuclear contraction, retraction, of \\nthe old polar schema that always maintained a minimal distance between cause and \\neffect, between subject and object: precisely the distance of meaning, the gap, the \\ndifference, the smallest possible gap (PPEP!),*8 irreducible under pain of reabsorption \\ninto an aleatory and indeterminate process whose discourse can no longer account for it, \\nbecause it is itself a determined order. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt is this gap that vanishes in the process of genetic coding, in which indeterminacy is not \\nso much a question of molecular randomness as of the abolition, pure and simple, of the \\nrelation. In the process of molecular control, which \"goes\" from the DNA nucleus to the \\n\"substance\" that it \"informs,\" there is no longer the traversal of an effect, of an energy, of \\na determination, of a message. \"Order, signal, impulse, message\": all of these attempt to \\nrender the thing intelligible to us, but by analogy, retranscribing in terms of inscription, \\nof a vector, of decoding, a dimension of which we know nothing - it is no longer even a \\n\"dimension,\" or perhaps it is the fourth (which is denned, however, in Einsteinian \\nrelativity by the absorption of the distinct poles of space and time). In fact, this whole \\nprocess can only be understood in its negative form: nothing separates one pole from \\nanother anymore, the beginning from the end; there is a kind of contraction of one over \\nthe other, a fantastic telescoping, a collapse of the two traditional poles into each other: \\nimplosion - an absorption of the radiating mode of causality, of the differential mode of \\ndetermination, with its positive and negative charge - an implosion of meaning. That is \\nwhere simulation begins. \\n\\nEverywhere, in no matter what domain - political, biological, psychological, mediatized - \\nin which the distinction between these two poles can no longer be maintained, one enters \\ninto simulation, and thus into absolute manipulation - not into passivity, but into the \\ndifferentiation of the active and the passive. DNA realizes this aleatory reduction at the \\nlevel of living matter. Television, in the case of the Louds, also reaches this indefinite \\nlimit in which, vis-a-vis TV, they are neither more nor less active or passive than a living \\nsubstance is vis-a-vis its molecular code. Here and there, a single nebula whose simple \\nelements are indecipherable, whose truth is indecipherable. \\n\\nTHE ORBITAL AND THE NUCLEAR \\n\\nThe apotheosis of simulation: the nuclear. However, the balance of terror is never \\nanything but the spectacular slope of a system of deterrence that has insinuated itself \\nfrom the inside into all the cracks of daily life. Nuclear suspension only serves to seal the \\ntrivialized system of deterrence that is at the heart of the media, of the violence without \\nconsequences that reigns throughout the world, of the aleatory apparatus of all the \\nchoices that are made for us. The most insignificant of our behaviors is regulated by \\nneutralized, indifferent, equivalent signs, by zero-sum signs like those that regulate the \\n\"strategy of games\" (but the true equation is elsewhere, and the unknown is precisely that \\nvariable of simulation which makes of the atomic arsenal itself a hyperreal form, a \\nsimulacrum that dominates everything and reduces all \"ground-level\" events to being \\nnothing but ephemeral scenarios, transforming the life left us into survival, into a stake \\nwithout stakes - not even into a life insurance policy: into a policy that already has no \\nvalue). \\n\\nIt is not the direct threat of atomic destruction that paralyzes our lives, it is deterrence \\nthat gives them leukemia. And this deterrence comes from that fact that even the real \\natomic clash is precluded - precluded like the eventuality of the real in a system of signs. \\nThe whole world pretends to believe in the reality of this threat (this is understandable on \\nthe part of the military, the gravity of their exercise and the discourse of their \"strategy\" \\nare at stake), but it is precisely at this level that there are no strategic stakes. The whole \\noriginality of the situation lies in the improbability of destruction. \\n\\n\\n\\nDeterrence precludes war - the archaic violence of expanding systems. Deterrence itself \\nis the neutral, implosive violence of metastable systems or systems in involution. There is \\nno longer a subject of deterrence, nor an adversary nor a strategy - it is a planetary \\nstructure of the annihilation of stakes. Atomic war, like the Trojan War, will not take \\nplace. The risk of nuclear annihilation only serves as a pretext, through the sophistication \\nof weapons (a sophistication that surpasses any possible objective to such an extent that it \\nis itself a symptom of nullity), for installing a universal security system, a universal \\nlockup and control system whose deterrent effect is not at all aimed at an atomic clash \\n(which was never in question, except without a doubt in the very initial stages of the cold \\nwar, when one still confused the nuclear apparatus with conventional war) but, rather, at \\nthe much greater probability of any real event, of anything that would be an event in the \\ngeneral system and upset its balance. The balance of terror is the terror of balance. \\n\\nDeterrence is not a strategy, it circulates and is exchanged between nuclear protagonists \\nexactly as is international capital in the orbital zone of monetary speculation whose \\nfluctuations suffice to control all global exchanges. Thus the money of destruction \\n(without any reference to real destruction, any more than floating capital has a real \\nreferent of production) that circulates in nuclear orbit suffices to control all the violence \\nand potential conflicts around the world. \\n\\nWhat is hatched in the shadow of this mechanism with the pretext of a maximal, \\n\"objective,\" threat, and thanks to Damocles\\' nuclear sword, is the perfection of the best \\nsystem of control that has ever existed. And the progressive satellization of the whole \\nplanet through this hypermodel of security. \\n\\nThe same goes for peaceful nuclear power stations. Pacification does not distinguish \\nbetween the civil and the military: everywhere where irreversible apparatuses of control \\nare elaborated, everywhere where the notion of security becomes omnipotent, \\neverywhere where the norm replaces the old arsenal of laws and violence (including \\nwar), it is the system of deterrence that grows, and around it grows the historical, social, \\nand political desert. A gigantic involution that makes every conflict, every finality, every \\nconfrontation contract in proportion to this blackmail that interrupts, neutralizes, freezes \\nthem all. No longer can any revolt, any story be deployed according to its own logic \\nbecause it risks annihilation. No strategy is possible any longer, and escalation is only a \\npuerile game given over to the military. The political stake is dead, only simulacra of \\nconflicts and carefully circumscribed stakes remain. \\n\\nThe \"space race\" played exactly the same role as nuclear escalation. This is why the \\nspace program was so easily able to replace it in the 1960s (Kennedy/Khrushchev), or to \\ndevelop concurrently as a form of \"peaceful coexistence.\" Because what, ultimately, is \\nthe function of the space program, of the conquest of the moon, of the launching of \\nsatellites if not the institution of a model of universal gravitation, of satellization of \\nwhich the lunar module is the perfect embryo? Programmed microcosm, where nothing \\ncan be left to chance. Trajectory, energy, calculation, physiology, psychology, \\nenvironment - nothing can be left to contingencies, this is the total universe of the norm - \\nthe Law no longer exists, it is the operational immanence of every detail that is law. A \\nuniverse purged of all threat of meaning, in a state of asepsis and weightlessness - it is \\n\\n\\n\\nthis very perfection that is fascinating. The exaltation of the crowds was not a response to \\nthe event of Rinding on the moon or of sending a man into space (this would be, rather, \\nthe fulfillment of an earlier dream), rather, we are dumbfounded by the perfection of the \\nprogramming and the technical manipulation, by the immanent wonder of the \\nprogrammed unfolding of events. Fascination with the maximal norm and the mastery of \\nprobability. Vertigo of the model, which unites with the model of death, but without fear \\nor drive. Because if the law, with its aura of transgression, if order, with its aura of \\nviolence, still taps a perverse imaginary, the norm fixes, fascinates, stupefies, and makes \\nevery imaginary involute. One no longer fantasizes about the minutiae of a program. Just \\nwatching it produces vertigo. The vertigo of a world without flaws. \\n\\nNow, it is the same model of programmatic infallibility, of maximum security and \\ndeterrence that today controls the spread of the social. There lies the true nuclear fallout: \\nthe meticulous operation of technology serves as a model for the meticulous operation of \\nthe social. Here as well, nothing will be left to chance, moreover this is the essence of \\nsocialization, which began centuries ago, but which has now entered its accelerated \\nphase, toward a limit that one believed would be explosive (revolution), but which for the \\nmoment is translated by an inverse, implosive, irreversible process: the generalized \\ndeterrence of chance, of accident, of transversality, of finality, of contradiction, rupture, \\nor complexity in a sociality illuminated by the norm, doomed to the descriptive \\ntransparency of mechanisms of information. In fact, the spatial and nuclear models do not \\nhave their own ends: neither the discovery of the moon, nor military and strategic \\nsuperiority. Their truth is to be the models of simulation, the model vectors of a system of \\nplanetary control (where even the superpowers of this scenario are not free - the whole \\nworld is satellized). *9 \\n\\nResist the evidence: in satellization, he who is satellized is not who one might think. \\nThrough the orbital inscription of a spatial object, it is the planet earth that becomes a \\nsatellite, it is the terrestrial principle of reality that becomes eccentric, hyperreal, and \\ninsignificant. Through the orbital instantiation of a system of control like peaceful \\ncoexistence, all the terrestrial microsystems are satellized and lose their autonomy. All \\nenergy, all events are absorbed by this eccentric gravitation, everything condenses and \\nimplodes toward the only micromodel of control (the orbital satellite), as conversely, in \\nthe other, biological, dimension, everything converges and implodes on the molecular \\nmicromodel of the genetic code. Between the two, in this forking of the nuclear and the \\ngenetic, in the simultaneous assumption of the two fundamental codes of deterrence, \\nevery principle of meaning is absorbed, every deployment of the real is impossible. \\n\\nThe simultaneity of two events in the month of July 1975 illustrated this in a striking \\nmanner: the linkup in space of the two American and Soviet supersatellites, apotheosis of \\npeaceful coexistence - the suppression by the Chinese of ideogrammatic writing and \\nconversion to the Roman alphabet. The latter signifies the \"orbital\" instantiation of an \\nabstract and modelized system of signs, into whose orbit all the once unique forms of \\nstyle and writing will be reabsorbed. The satellization of language: the means for the \\nChinese to enter the system of peaceful coexistence, which is inscribed in their heavens \\nat precisely the same time by the linkup of the two satellites. Orbital flight of the Big \\nTwo, neutralization and homogenization of everyone else on earth. \\n\\n\\n\\nYet, despite this deterrence by the orbital power - the nuclear or molecular code - events \\ncontinue at ground level, misfortunes are even more numerous, given the global process \\nof the contiguity and simultaneity of data. But, subtly, they no longer have any meaning, \\nthey are no longer anything but the duplex effect of simulation at the summit. The best \\nexample can only be that of the war in Vietnam, because it took place at the intersection \\nof a maximum historical and \"revolutionary\" stake, and of the installation of this \\ndeterrent authority. What meaning did this war have, and wasn\\'t its unfolding a means of \\nsealing the end of history in the decisive and culminating historic event of our era? \\n\\nWhy did this war, so hard, so long, so ferocious, vanish from one day to the next as if by \\nmagic? \\n\\nWhy did this American defeat (the largest reversal in the history of the USA) have no \\ninternal repercussions in America? If it had really signified the failure of the planetary \\nstrategy of the United States, it would necessarily have completely disrupted its internal \\nbalance and the American political system. Nothing of the sort occurred. \\n\\nSomething else, then, took place. This war, at bottom, was nothing but a crucial episode \\nof peaceful coexistence. It marked the arrival of China to peaceful coexistence. The \\nnonintervention of China obtained and secured after many years, Chinas apprenticeship \\nto a global modus vivendi, the shift from a global strategy of revolution to one of shared \\nforces and empires, the transition from a radical alternative to political alternation in a \\nsystem now essentially regulated (the normalization of Peking - Washington relations): \\nthis was what was at stake in the war in Vietnam, and in this sense, the USA pulled out of \\nVietnam but won the war. \\n\\nAnd the war ended \"spontaneously\" when this objective was achieved. That is why it was \\ndeescalated, demobilized so easily. \\n\\nThis same reduction of forces can be seen on the field. The war lasted as long as elements \\nirreducible to a healthy politics and discipline of power, even a Communist one, \\nremained unliquidated. When at last the war had passed into the hands of regular troops \\nin the North and escaped that of the resistance, the war could stop: it had attained its \\nobjective. The stake is thus that of a political relay. As soon as the Vietnamese had \\nproved that they were no longer the carriers of an unpredictable subversion, one could let \\nthem take over. That theirs is a Communist order is not serious in the end: it had proved \\nitself, it could be trusted. It is even more effective than capitalism in the liquidation of \\n\"savage\" and archaic precapitalist structures. \\n\\nSame scenario in the Algerian war. \\n\\nThe other aspect of this war and of all wars today: behind the armed violence, the \\nmurderous antagonism of the adversaries - which seems a matter of life and death, which \\nis played out as such (or else one could never send people to get themselves killed in this \\nkind of thing), behind this simulacrum of fighting to the death and of ruthless global \\nstakes, the two adversaries are fundamentally in solidarity against something else, \\nunnamed, never spoken, but whose objective outcome in war, with the equal complicity \\nof the two adversaries, is total liquidation. Tribal, communitarian, precapitalist structures, \\n\\n\\n\\nevery form of exchange, of language, of symbolic organization, that is what must be \\nabolished, that is the object of murder in war - and war itself, in its immense, spectacular \\ndeath apparatus, is nothing but the medium of this process of the terrorist rationalization \\nof the social - the murder on which sociality will be founded, whatever its allegiance, \\nCommunist or capitalist. Total complicity, or division of labor between two adversaries \\n(who may even consent to enormous sacrifices for it) for the very end of reshaping and \\ndomesticating social relations. \\n\\n\"The North Vietnamese were advised to countenance a scenario for liquidating the \\nAmerican presence in the course of which, of course, one must save face.\" \\n\\nThis scenario: the extremely harsh bombardments of Hanoi. Their untenable character \\nmust not conceal the fact that they were nothing but a simulacrum to enable the \\nVietnamese to seem to countenance a compromise and for Nixon to make the Americans \\nswallow the withdrawal of their troops. The game was already won, nothing was \\nobjectively at stake but the verisimilitude of the final montage. \\n\\nThe moralists of war, the holders of high wartime values should not be too discouraged: \\nthe war is no less atrocious for being only a simulacrum - the flesh suffers just the same, \\nand the dead and former combatants are worth the same as in other wars. This objective \\nis always fulfilled, just like that of the charting of territories and of disciplinary sociality. \\nWhat no longer exists is the adversity of the adversaries, the reality of antagonistic \\ncauses, the ideological seriousness of war. And also the reality of victory or defeat, war \\nbeing a process that triumphs well beyond these appearances. \\n\\nIn any case, the pacification (or the deterrence) that dominates us today is beyond war \\nand peace, it is that at every moment war and peace are equivalent. \"War is peace,\" said \\nOrwell. There also, the two differential poles implode into each other, or recycle one \\nanother - a simultaneity of contradictions that is at once the parody and the end of every \\ndialectic. Thus one can completely miss the truth of a war: namely, that it was finished \\nwell before it started, that there was an end to war at the heart of the war itself, and that \\nperhaps it never started. Many other events (the oil crisis, etc.) never started, never \\nexisted, except as artificial occurrences - abstract, ersatz, and as artifacts of history, \\ncatastrophes and crises destined to maintain a historical investment under hypnosis. The \\nmedia and the official news service are only there to maintain the illusion of an actuality, \\nof the reality of the stakes, of the objectivity of facts. All the events are to be read \\nbackward, or one becomes aware (as with the Communists \"in power\" in Italy the retro, \\nposthumous rediscovery of the gulags and Soviet dissidents like the almost contemporary \\ndiscovery, by a moribund ethnology, of the lost \"difference\" of Savages) that all these \\nthings arrived too late, with a history of delay, a spiral of delay, that they long ago \\nexhausted their meaning and only live from an artificial effervescence of signs, that all \\nthese events succeed each other without logic, in the most contradictory, complete \\nequivalence, in a profound indifference to their consequences (but this is because there \\nare none: they exhaust themselves in their spectacular promotion) - all \"newsreel\" \\nfootage thus gives the sinister impression of kitsch, of retro and pomo at the same time - \\ndoubtless everyone knows this, and no one really accepts it. The reality of simulation is \\nunbearable - crueler than Artaud\\'s Theater of Cruelty, which was still an attempt to create \\na dramaturgy of life, the last gasp of an ideality of the body, of blood, of violence in a \\n\\n\\n\\nsystem that was already taking it away, toward a reabsorption of all the stakes without a \\ntrace of blood. For us the trick has been played. All dramaturgy, and even all real writing \\nof cruelty has disappeared. Simulation is the master, and we only have a right to the retro, \\nto the phantom, parodic rehabilitation of all lost referentials. Everything still unfolds \\naround us, in the cold light of deterrence (including Artaud, who has the right like \\neverything else to his revival, to a second existence as the referential of cruelty). \\n\\nThis is why nuclear proliferation does not increase the risk of either an atomic clash or an \\naccident - save in the interval when the \"young\" powers could be tempted to make a \\nnondeterrent, \"real\" use of it (as the Americans did in Hiroshima - but precisely only they \\nhad a right to this \"use value\" of the bomb, all of those who have acquired it since will be \\ndeterred from using it by the very fact of possessing it). Entry into the atomic club, so \\nprettily named, very quickly effaces (as unionization does in the working world) any \\ninclination toward violent intervention. Responsibility, control, censure, self-deterrence \\nalways grow more rapidly than the forces or the weapons at our disposal: this is the secret \\nof the social order. Thus the very possibility of paralyzing a whole country by flicking a \\nswitch makes it so that the electrical engineers will never use this weapon: the whole \\nmyth of the total and revolutionary strike crumbles at the very moment when the means \\nare available - but alas precisely because those means are available. Therein lies the \\nwhole process of deterrence. \\n\\nIt is thus perfectly probable that one day we will see nuclear powers export atomic \\nreactors, weapons, and bombs to every latitude. Control by threat will be replaced by the \\nmore effective strategy of pacification through the bomb and through the possession of \\nthe bomb. The \"little\" powers, believing that they are buying their independent striking \\nforce, will buy the virus of deterrence, of their own deterrence. The same goes for the \\natomic reactors that we have already sent them: so many neutron bombs knocking out all \\nhistorical vimlence, all risk of explosion. In this sense, the nuclear everywhere \\ninaugurates an accelerated process of implosion, it freezes everything around it, it \\nabsorbs all living energy. \\n\\nThe nuclear is at once the culminating point of available energy and the maximization of \\nenergy control systems. Lockdown and control increase in direct proportion to (and \\nundoubtedly even faster than) liberating potentialities. This was already the aporia of the \\nmodern revolution. It is still the absolute paradox of the nuclear. Energies freeze in their \\nown fire, they deter themselves. One can no longer imagine what project, what power, \\nwhat strategy, what subject could exist behind this enclosure, this vast saturation of a \\nsystem by its own forces, now neutralized, unusable, unintelligible, nonexplosive - \\nexcept for the possibility of an explosion toward the center, of an implosion where all \\nthese energies would be abolished in a catastrophic process (in the literal sense, that is to \\nsay in the sense of a reversion of the whole cycle toward a minimal point, of a reversion \\nof energies toward a minimal threshold). \\n\\n* NOTES * \\n\\n1. Cf. J. Baudrillard, \"L\\'ordre des simulacres\" (The order of simulacra), in L\\'echange \\nsymbolique et la mort (Symbolic exchange and death) (Paris: Gallimard, 1976). \\n\\n\\n\\n2.

Perniola, leones, visions, simulacres (Icons, visions, simulacra), 39. \\n\\n4. This does not necessarily result in despairing of meaning, but just as much in the \\nimprovisation of meaning, of nonmeaning, of many simultaneous meanings that destroy \\neach other. \\n\\n5. Taken together, the energy crisis and the ecological mise-en-scene are themselves a \\ndisaster movie, in the same style (and with the same value) as those that currently \\ncomprise the golden days of Hollywood. It is useless to laboriously interpret these films \\nin terms of their relation to an \"objective\" social crisis or even to an \"objective\" phantasm \\nof disaster. It is in another sense that it must be said that it is the social itself that, in \\ncontemporary discourse, is organised along the lines of a disaster-movie script. (Cf. M. \\nMakarius, La strategic de la catastrophe [The strategy of disaster], 115.) \\n\\n6. To this flagging investment in work corresponds a parallel decline in the investment in \\nconsumption. Goodbye to use value or to the prestige of the automobile, goodbye \\namorous discourses that neatly opposed the object of enjoyment to the object of work. \\nAnother discourse takes hold that is a discourse of work on the object of consumption \\naiming for an active, constraining, puritan reinvestment (use less gas, watch out for your \\nsafety, you\\'ve gone over the speed limit, etc.) to which the characteristics of automobiles \\npretend to adapt. Rediscovering a stake through the transposition of these two poles. \\nWork becomes the object of a need, the car becomes the object of work. There is no \\nbetter proof of the lack of differentiation among all the stakes. It is through the same \\nslippage between the \"right\" to vote and electoral \"duty\" that the divestment of the \\npolitical sphere is signaled. \\n\\n7. The medium/message confusion is certainly a corollary of that between the sender and \\nthe receiver, thus sealing the disappearance of all dual, polar structures that formed the \\ndiscursive organization of language, of all determined articulation of meaning reflecting \\nJakobson\\'s famous grid of functions. That discourse \"circulates\" is to be taken literally: \\nthat is, it no longer goes from one point to another, but it traverses a cycle that without \\ndistinction includes the positions of transmitter and receiver, now unlocatable as such. \\nThus there is no instance of power, no instance of transmission - power is something that \\ncirculates and whose source can no longer be located, a cycle in which the positions of \\nthe dominator and the dominated are exchanged in an endless reversion that is also the \\nend of power in its classical definition. The circularization of power, of knowledge, of \\ndiscourse puts an end to any localization of instances and poles. In the psychoanalytic \\ninterpretation itself, the \"power\" of the interpreter does not come from any outside \\ninstance but from the interpreted himself. This changes everything, because one can \\nalways ask of the traditional holders of power where they get their power from. Who \\nmade you duke? The king. Who made you king? God. Only God no longer answers. But \\nto the question: who made you a psychoanalyst? the analyst can well reply: You. Thus is \\nexpressed, by an inverse simulation, the passage from the \"analyzed\" to the \"analysand,\" \\nfrom passive to active, which simply describes the spiraling effect of the shifting of \\npoles, the effect of circularity in which power is lost, is dissolved, is resolved in perfect \\n\\n\\n\\nmanipulation (it is no longer of the order of directive power and of the gaze, but of the \\norder of tactility and commutation). See also the state/family circularity assured by the \\nfluctuation and metastatic regulation of the images of the social and the private (J. \\nDonzelot, La police des/amilles [The policing of families]). \\n\\nImpossible now to pose the famous question: \"From what position do you speak?\" - \\n\"How do you know?\" \"From where do you get your power?\" without hearing the \\nimmediate response: \"But it is of you (from you) that I speak\" - meaning, it is you who \\nare speaking, you who know, you who are the power. Gigantic circumvolution, \\ncircumlocution of the spoken word, which is equal to a blackmail with no end, to a \\ndeterrence that cannot be appealed of the subject presumed to speak, leaving him without \\na reply, because to the question that he poses one ineluctably replies: but you are the \\nanswer, or: your question is already an answer, etc. - the whole strangulatory \\nsophistication of intercepting speech, of the forced confession in the guise of freedom of \\nexpression, of trapping the subject in his own interrogation, of the precession of the reply \\nto the question (all the violence of interpretation lies there, as well as that of the \\nconscious or unconscious management of the \"spoken word\" [parole]). \\n\\nThis simulacrum of the inversion or the involution of poles, this clever subterfuge, which \\nis the secret of the whole discourse of manipulation and thus, today, in every domain, the \\nsecret of any new power in the erasure of the scene of power, in the assumption of all \\nwords from which has resulted this fantastic silent majority characteristic of our time - all \\nof this started without a doubt in the political sphere with the democractic simulacrum, \\nwhich today is the substitution for the power of God with the power of the people as the \\nsource of power, and of power as emanation with power as representation. Anti- \\nCopernican revolution: no transcendental instance either of the sun or of the luminous \\nsources of power and knowledge - everything comes from the people and everything \\nreturns to them. It is with this magnificent recycling that the universal simulacrum of \\nmanipulation, from the scenario of mass suffrage to the present-day phantoms of opinion \\npolls, begins to be put in place. \\n\\n8. PPEP is an acronym for smallest possible gap, or \"plus petit ecart possible.\"-TRANS. \\n\\n9. Paradox: all bombs are clean: their only pollution is the system of security and of \\ncontrol they radiate as long as they don\\'t explode. \\n\\n\\n\\nHISTORY: A RETRO SCENARIO \\n\\n\\nIn a violent and contemporary period of history (let\\'s say between the two world wars and \\nthe cold war), it is myth that invades cinema as imaginary content. It is the golden age of \\ndespotic and legendary resurrections. Myth, chased from the real by the violence of \\nhistory, finds refuge in cinema. \\n\\nToday, it is history itself that invades the cinema according to the same scenario - the \\nhistorical stake chased from our lives by this sort of immense neutralization, which is \\ndubbed peaceful coexistence on a global level, and pacified monotony on the quotidian \\nlevel - this history exorcised by a slowly or brutally congealing society celebrates its \\nresurrection in force on the screen, according to the same process that used to make lost \\nmyths live again. \\n\\nHistory is our lost referential, that is to say our myth. It is by virtue of this fact that it \\ntakes the place of myths on the screen. The illusion would be to congratulate oneself on \\nthis \"awareness of history on the part of cinema,\" as one congratulated oneself on the \\n\"entrance of politics into the university.\" Same misunderstanding, same mystification. \\n\\nThe politics that enter the university are those that come from history, a retro politics, \\nemptied of substance and legalized in their superficial exercise, with the air of a game \\nand a field of adventure, this kind of politics is like sexuality or permanent education (or \\nlike social security in its time), that is, posthumous liberalization. \\n\\nThe great event of this period, the great trauma, is this decline of strong referentials, these \\ndeath pangs of the real and of the rational that open onto an age of simulation. Whereas \\nso many generations, and particularly the last, lived in the march of history, in the \\neuphoric or catastrophic expectation of a revolution - today one has the impression that \\nhistory has retreated, leaving behind it an indifferent nebula, traversed by currents, but \\nemptied of references. It is into this void that the phantasms of a past history recede, the \\npanoply of events, ideologies, retro fashions - no longer so much because people believe \\nin them or still place some hope in them, but simply to resurrect the period when at least \\nthere was history, at least there was violence (albeit fascist), when at least life and death \\nwere at stake. Anything serves to escape this void, this leukemia of history and of \\npolitics, this hemorrhage of values - it is in proportion to this distress that all content can \\nbe evoked pell-mell, that all previous history is resurrected in bulk - a controlling idea no \\nlonger selects, only nostalgia endlessly accumulates: war, fascism, the pageantry of the \\nbelle epoque, or the revolutionary struggles, everything is equivalent and is mixed \\nindiscriminately in the same morose and funereal exaltation, in the same retro \\nfascination. There is however a privileging of the immediately preceding era (fascism, \\nwar, the period immediately following the war - the innumerable films that play on these \\nthemes for us have a closer, more perverse, denser, more confused essence). One can \\nexplain it by evoking the Freudian theory of fetishism (perhaps also a retro hypothesis). \\nThis trauma (loss of referentials) is similar to the discovery of the difference between the \\nsexes in children, as serious, as profound, as irreversible: the fetishization of an object \\nintervenes to obscure this unbearable discovery, but precisely, says Freud, this object is \\nnot just any object, it is often the last object perceived before the traumatic discovery. \\nThus the fetishized history will preferably be the one immediately preceding our \\n\\n\\n\"irreferential\" era. Whence the omnipresence of fascism and of war in retro - a \\ncoincidence, an affinity that is not at all political; it is naive to conclude that the \\nevocation of fascism signals a current renewal of fascism (it is precisely because one is \\nno longer there, because one is in something else, which is still less amusing, it is for this \\nreason that fascism can again become fascinating in its filtered cruelty, aestheticized by \\nretro).* 1 \\n\\nHistory thus made its triumphal entry into cinema, posthumously (the term historical has \\nundergone the same fate: a \"historical\" moment, monument, congress, figure are in this \\nway designated as fossils). Its reinjection has no value as conscious awareness but only \\nas nostalgia for a lost referential. \\n\\nThis does not signify that history has never appeared in cinema as a powerful moment, as \\na contemporary process, as insurrection and not as resurrection. In the \"real\" as in \\ncinema, there was history but there isn\\'t any anymore. Today, the history that is \"given \\nback\" to us (precisely because it was taken from us) has no more of a relation to a \\n\"historical real\" than neofiguration in painting does to the classical figuration of the real. \\nNeofiguration is an invocation of resemblance, but at the same time the flagrant proof of \\nthe disappearance of objects in their very representation: hyperreal. Therein objects shine \\nin a sort of hyperresemblance (like history in contemporary cinema) that makes it so that \\nfundamentally they no longer resemble anything, except the empty figure of resemblance, \\nthe empty form of representation. It is a question of life or death: these objects are no \\nlonger either living or deadly. That is why they are so exact, so minute, frozen in the state \\nin which a brutal loss of the real would have seized them. All, but not only, those \\nhistorical films whose very perfection is disquieting: Chinatown, Three Days of the \\nCondor, Barry Lyndon, 1900, All the President\\'s Men, etc. One has the impression of it \\nbeing a question of perfect remakes, of extraordinary montages that emerge more from a \\ncombinatory culture (or McLuhanesque mosaic), of large photo-, kino-, \\nhistoricosynthesis machines, etc., rather than one of veritable films. Let\\'s understand each \\nother: their quality is not in question. The problem is rather that in some sense we are left \\ncompletely indifferent. Take The Last Picture Show: like me, you would have had to be \\nsufficiently distracted to have thought it to be an original production from the 1950s: a \\nvery good film about the customs in and the atmosphere of the American small town. Just \\na slight suspicion: it was a little too good, more in tune, better than the others, without the \\npsychological, moral, and sentimental blotches of the films of that era. Stupefaction when \\none discovers that it is a 1970s film, perfect retro, purged, pure, the hyperrealist \\nrestitution of 1950s cinema. One talks of remaking silent films, those will also \\ndoubtlessly be better than those of the period. A whole generation of films is emerging \\nthat will be to those one knew what the android is to man: marvelous artifacts, without \\nweakness, pleasing simulacra that lack only the imaginary, and the hallucination inherent \\nto cinema. Most of what we see today (the best) is already of this order. Barry Lyndon is \\nthe best example: one never did better, one will never do better in ... in what? Not in \\nevoking, not even in evoking, in simulating. All the toxic radiation has been filtered, all \\nthe ingredients are there, in precise doses, not a single error. \\n\\nCool, cold pleasure, not even aesthetic in the strict sense: functional pleasure, equational \\npleasure, pleasure of machination. One only has to dream of Visconti (Guepard, Senso, \\netc., which in certain respects make one think of Barry Lyndon) to grasp the difference, \\n\\n\\n\\nnot only in style, but in the cinematographic act. In Visconti, there is meaning, history, a \\nsensual rhetoric, dead time, a passionate game, not only in the historical content, but in \\nthe mise-en-scene. None of that in Kubrick, who manipulates his film like a chess player, \\nwho makes an operational scenario of history. And this does not return to the old \\nopposition between the spirit of finesse and the spirit of geometry: that opposition still \\ncomes from the game and the stakes of meaning, whereas we are entering an era of films \\nthat in themselves no longer have meaning strictly speaking, an era of great synthesizing \\nmachines of varying geometry. \\n\\nIs there something of this already in Leone\\'s Westerns? Maybe. All the registers slide in \\nthat direction. Chinatown: it is the detective movie renamed by laser. It is not really a \\nquestion of perfection: technical perfection can be part of meaning, and in that case it is \\nneither retro nor hyperrealist, it is an effect of art. Here, technical perfection is an effect \\nof the model: it is one of the referential tactical values. In the absence of real syntax of \\nmeaning, one has nothing but the tactical values of a group in which are admirably \\ncombined, for example, the CIA as a mythological machine that does everything, Robert \\nRedford as polyvalent star, social relations as a necessary reference to history, technical \\nvirtuosity as a necessary reference to cinema. \\n\\nThe cinema and its trajectory: from the most fantastic or mythical to the realistic and the \\nhyperrealistic. \\n\\nThe cinema in its current efforts is getting closer and closer, and with greater and greater \\nperfection, to the absolute real, in its banality, its veracity, in its naked obviousness, in its \\nboredom, and at the same time in its presumption, in its pretension to being the real, the \\nimmediate, the unsignified, which is the craziest of undertakings (similarly, \\nfunctionalism\\'s pretension to designating - design - the greatest degree of correspondence \\nbetween the object and its function, and its use value, is a truly absurd enterprise); no \\nculture has ever had toward its signs this naive and paranoid, puritan and terrorist vision. \\n\\nTerrorism is always that of the real. \\n\\nConcurrently with this effort toward an absolute correspondence with the real, cinema \\nalso approaches an absolute correspondence with itself - and this is not contradictory: it \\nis the very definition of the hyperreal. Hypotyposis and specularity. Cinema plagiarizes \\nitself, recopies itself, remakes its classics, retroactivates its original myths, remakes the \\nsilent film more perfectly than the original, etc.: all of this is logical, the cinema is \\nfascinated by itself as a lost object as much as it (and we) are fascinated by the real as a \\nlost referent. The cinema and the imaginary (the novelistic, the mythical, unreality, \\nincluding the delirious use of its own technique) used to have a lively, dialectical, full, \\ndramatic relation. The relation that is being formed today between the cinema and the \\nreal is an inverse, negative relation: it results from the loss of specificity of one and of the \\nother. The cold collage, the cool promiscuity, the asexual nuptials of two cold media that \\nevolve in an asymptotic line toward each other: the cinema attempting to abolish itself in \\nthe cinematographic (or televised) hyperreal. \\n\\nHistory is a strong myth, perhaps, along with the unconscious, the last great myth. It is a \\nmyth that at once subtended the possibility of an \"objective\" enchainment of events and \\n\\n\\n\\ncauses and the possibility of a narrative enchainment of discourse. The age of history, if \\none can call it that, is also the age of the novel. It is this fabulous character, the mythical \\nenergy of an event or of a narrative, that today seems to be increasingly lost. Behind a \\nperformative and demonstrative logic: the obsession with historical fidelity, with a \\nperfect rendering (as elsewhere the obsession with real time or with the minute \\nquotidianeity of Jeanne Hilmann doing the dishes), this negative and implacable fidelity \\nto the materiality of the past, to a particular scene of the past or of the present, to the \\nrestitution of an absolute simulacrum of the past or the present, which was substituted for \\nall other value - we are all complicitous in this, and this is irreversible. Because cinema \\nitself contributed to the disappearance of history, and to the advent of the archive. \\nPhotography and cinema contributed in large part to the secularization of history, to \\nfixing it in its visible, \"objective\" form at the expense of the myths that once traversed it. \\nToday cinema can place all its talent, all its technology in the service of reanimating what \\nit itself contributed to liquidating. It only resurrects ghosts, and it itself is lost therein. \\n\\n* NOTE * \\n\\n1. Fascism itself, the mystery of its appearance and of its collective energy, with which \\nno interpretation has been able to come to grips (neither the Marxist one of political \\nmanipulation by dominant classes, nor the Reichian one of the sexual repression of the \\nmasses, nor the Deleuzian one of despotic paranoia), can already be interpreted as the \\n\"irrational\" excess of mythic and political referentials, the mad intensification of \\ncollective value (blood, race, people, etc.), the reinjection of death, of a \"political \\naesthetic of death\" at a time when the process of the disenchantment of value and of \\ncollective values, of the rational secularization and unidimensionalization of all life, of \\nthe operationalization of all social and individual life already makes itself strongly felt in \\nthe West. Yet again, everything seems to escape this catastrophe of value, this \\nneutralization and pacification of life. Fascism is a resistance to this, even if it is a \\nprofound, irrational, demented resistance, it would not have tapped into this massive \\nenergy if it hadn\\'t been a resistance to something much worse. Fascism\\'s cruelty, its terror \\nis on the level of this other terror that is the confusion of the real and the rational, which \\ndeepened in the West, and it is a response to that. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHOLOCAUST \\n\\n\\nForgetting extermination is part of extermination, because it is also the extermination of \\nmemory, of history, of the social, etc. This forgetting is as essential as the event, in any \\ncase unlocatable by us, inaccessible to us in its truth. This forgetting is still too \\ndangerous, it must be effaced by an artificial memory (today, everywhere, it is artificial \\nmemories that efface the memory of man, that efface man in his own memory). This \\nartificial memory will be the restaging of extermination - but late, much too late for it to \\nbe able to make real waves and profoundly disturb something, and especially, especially \\nthrough a medium that is itself cold, radiating forgetfulness, deterrence, and \\nextermination in a still more systematic way, if that is possible, than the camps \\nthemselves. One no longer makes the Jews pass through the crematorium or the gas \\nchamber, but through the sound track and image track, through the universal screen and \\nthe microprocessor. Forgetting, annihilation, finally achieves its aesthetic dimension in \\nthis way - it is achieved in retro, finally elevated here to a mass level. \\n\\nEven the type of sociohistorical dimension that still remained forgotten in the form of \\nguilt, of shameful latency, of the not-said, no longer exists, because now \"everyone \\nknows,\" everybody has trembled and bawled in the face of extermination - a sure sign \\nthat \"that\" will never again occur. But what one exorcises in this way at little cost, and \\nfor the price of a few tears, will never in effect be reproduced, because it has always been \\nin the midst of currently reproducing itself, and precisely in the very form in which one \\npretends to denounce it, in the medium itself of this supposed exorcism: television. Same \\nprocess of forgetting, of liquidation, of extermination, same annihilation of memories and \\nof history, same inverse, implosive radiation, same absorption without an echo, same \\nblack hole as Auschwitz. And one would like to have us believe that TV will lift the \\nweight of Auschwitz by making a collective awareness radiate, whereas television is its \\nperpetuation in another guise, this time no longer under the auspices of a site of \\nannihilation, but of a medium of deterrence. \\n\\nWhat no one wants to understand is that Holocaust is primarily (and exclusively) an \\nevent, or, rather, a televised object (fundamental rule of McLuhan\\'s, which must not be \\nforgotten), that is to say, that one attempts to rekindle a cold historical event, tragic but \\ncold, the first major event of cold systems, of cooling systems, of systems of deterrence \\nand extermination that will then be deployed in other forms (including the cold war, etc.) \\nand in regard to cold masses (the Jews no longer even concerned with their own death, \\nand the eventually self-managed masses no longer even in revolt: deterred until death, \\ndeterred from their very own death) to rekindle this cold event through a cold medium, \\ntelevision, and for the masses who are themselves cold, who will only have the \\nopportunity for a tactile thrill and a posthumous emotion, a deterrent thrill as well, which \\n\"vill make them spill into forgetting with a kind of good aesthetic conscience of the \\ncatastrophe. \\n\\nIn order to rekindle all that, the whole political and pedagogical orchestration that came \\nfrom every direction to attempt to give meaning to the event (the televised event this \\ntime) was not at all excessive. Panicked blackmailing around the possible consequence of \\nthis broadcast on the imagination of children and others. All the pedagogues and social \\n\\n\\nworkers mobilized to filter the thing, as if there were some danger of infection in this \\nartificial resurrection! The danger was really rather the opposite: from the cold to the \\ncold, the social inertia of cold systems, of TV in particular. It was thus necessary that the \\nwhole world mobilize itself to remake the social, a hot social, heated discussion, hence \\ncommunication, from the cold monster of extermination. One lacks stakes, investment, \\nhistory, speech. That is the fundamental problem. The objective is thus to produce them \\nat all cost, and this broadcast served this purpose: to capture the artificial heat of a dead \\nevent to warm the dead body of the social. Whence the addition of the supplementary \\nmedium to expand on the effect through feedback: immediate polls sanctioning the \\nmassive effect of the broadcast, the collective impact of the message - whereas it is well \\nunderstood that the polls only verify the televisual success of the medium itself. But this \\nconfusion will never be lifted. From there, it is necessary to speak of the cold light of \\ntelevision, why it is harmless to the imagination (including that of children) because it no \\nlonger carries any imaginary and this for the simple reason that it is no longer an image. \\nBy contrast with the cinema, which is still blessed (but less and less so because more and \\nmore contaminated by TV) with an intense imaginary - because the cinema is an image. \\nThat is to say not only a screen and a visual form, but a myth, something that still retains \\nsomething of the double, of the phantasm, of the mirror, of the dream, etc. Nothing of any \\nof this in the \"TV\" image, which suggests nothing, which mesmerizes, which itself is \\nnothing but a screen, not even that: a miniaturized terminal that, in fact, is immediately \\nlocated in your head - you are the screen, and the TV watches you - it transistorizes all \\nthe neurons and passes through like a magnetic tape - a tape, not an image. \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA SYNDROME \\n\\n\\nThe fundamental stake is at the level of television and information. Just as the \\nextermination of the Jews disappeared behind the televised event Holocaust - the cold \\nmedium of television having been simply substituted for the cold system of extermination \\none believed to be exorcising through it - so The China Syndrome is a great example of \\nthe supremacy of the televised event over the nuclear event which, itself, remains \\nimprobable and in some sense imaginary. \\n\\nBesides, the film shows this to be the case (without wanting to): that TV is present \\nprecisely where it happens is not coincidental, it is the intrusion of TV into the reactor \\nthat seems to give rise to the nuclear incident - because TV is like its anticipation and its \\nmodel in the everyday universe: telefission of the real and of the real world; because TV \\nand information in general are a form of catastrophe in the formal and topological sense \\nRene Thom gives the word: a radical qualitative change of a whole system. Or, rather, \\n\\nTV and the nuclear are of the same nature: behind the \"hot\" and negentropic concepts of \\nenergy and information, they have the same power of deterrence as cold systems do. TV \\nitself is also a nuclear process of chain reaction, but implosive: it cools and neutralizes \\nthe meaning and the energy of events. Thus the nuclear, behind the presumed risk of \\nexplosion, that is to say of hot catastrophe, conceals a long, cold catastrophe, the \\nuniversalization of a system of deterrence. \\n\\nAt the end of the film again comes the second massive intrusion of the press and of TV \\nthat instigates the drama - the murder of the technical director by the Special Forces, a \\ndrama that substitutes for the nuclear catastrophe that will not occur. \\n\\nThe homology of the nuclear and of television can be read directly in the images: nothing \\nresembles the control and telecommand headquarters of the nuclear power station more \\nthan TV studios, and the nuclear consoles are combined with those of the recording and \\nbroadcasting studios in the same imaginary. Thus everything takes place between these \\ntwo poles: of the other \"center,\" that of the reactor, in principle the veritable heart of the \\nmatter, we will know nothing; it, like the real, has vanished and become illegible, and is \\nat bottom unimportant in the film (when one attempts to suggest it to us, in its imminent \\ncatastrophe, it does not work on the imaginary plane: the drama unfolds on the screens \\nand nowhere else). \\n\\nHarrisburg,* 1 Watergate, and Network: such is the trilogy of The China Syndrome - an \\nindissoluble trilogy in which one no longer knows which is the effect and which is the \\nsymptom: the ideological argument (Watergate effect), isn\\'t it nothing but the symptom \\nof the nuclear (Harrisburg effect) or of the computer science model (Network effect) - the \\nreal (Harrisburg), isn\\'t it nothing but the symptom of the imaginary (Network and China \\nSyndrome) or the opposite? Marvelous indifferentiation, ideal constellation of \\nsimulation. Marvelous title, then, this China Syndrome, because the reversibility of \\nsymptoms and their convergence in the same process constitute precisely what we call a \\nsyndrome - that it is Chinese adds the poetic and intellectual quality of a conundrum or \\nsupplication. \\n\\n\\nObsessive conjunction of The China Syndrome and Harrisburg. But is all that so \\ninvoluntary? Without positing magical links between the simulacrum and the real, it is \\nclear that the Syndrome is not a stranger to the \"real\" accident in Harrisburg, not \\naccording to a causal logic, but according to the relations of contagion and silent analogy \\nthat link the real to models and to simulacra: to television\\'s induction of the nuclear into \\nthe film corresponds, with a troubling obviousness, the film\\'s induction of the nuclear \\nincident in Harrisburg. Strange precession of a film over the real, the most surprising that \\nwas given us to witness: the real corresponded point by point to the simulacrum, \\nincluding the suspended, incomplete character of the catastrophe, which is essential from \\nthe point of view of deterrence: the real arranged itself, in the image of the film, to \\nproduce a simulation of catastrophe. \\n\\nFrom there to reverse our logic and to see in The China Syndrome the veritable event and \\nin Harrisburg its simulacrum, there is only one step that must be cheerfully taken. \\nBecause it is via the same logic that, in the film, nuclear reality arises from the television \\neffect, and that in \"reality\" Harrisburg arises from the China Syndrome cinema effect. \\n\\nBut The China Syndrome is also not the original prototype of Harrisburg, one is not the \\nsimulacrum of which the other would be the real: there are only simulacra, and \\nHarrisburg is a sort of second-order simulation. There is certainly a chain reaction \\nsomewhere, and we will perhaps die of it, but this chain reaction is never that of the \\nnuclear, it is that of simulacra and of the simulation where all the energy of the real is \\neffectively swallowed, no longer in a spectacular nuclear explosion, but in a secret and \\ncontinuous implosion, and that today perhaps takes a more deathly turn than that of all \\nthe explosions that rock us. \\n\\nBecause an explosion is always a promise, it is our hope: note how much, in the film as \\nin Harrisburg, the whole world waits for something to blow up, for destruction to \\nannounce itself and remove us from this unnameable panic, from this panic of deterrence \\nthat it exercises in the invisible form of the nuclear. That the \"heart\" of the reactor at last \\nreveals its hot power of destruction, that it reassures us about the presence of energy, \\nalbeit catastrophic, and bestows its spectacle on us. Because unhappiness is when there is \\nno nuclear spectacle, no spectacle of nuclear energy in itself (Hiroshima is over), and it is \\nfor that reason that it is rejected - it would be perfectly accepted if it lent itself to \\nspectacle as previous forms of energy did. Parousia of catastrophe: substantial food for \\nour messianic libido. \\n\\nBut that is precisely what will never happen. What will happen will never again be the \\nexplosion, but the implosion. No more energy in its spectacular and pathetic form - all \\nthe romanticism of the explosion, which had so much charm, being at the same time that \\nof revolution - but the cold energy of the simulacrum and of its distillation in \\nhomeopathic doses in the cold systems of information. \\n\\nWhat else do the media dream of besides creating the event simply by their presence? \\nEveryone decries it, but everyone is secretly fascinated by this eventuality. Such is the \\nlogic of simulacra, it is no longer that of divine predestination, it is that of the precession \\nof models, but it is just as inexorable. And it is because of this that events no longer have \\nmeaning: it is not that they are insignificant in themselves, it is that they were preceded \\n\\n\\n\\nby the model, with which their processes only coincided. Thus it would have been \\nmarvelous to repeat the script for The China Syndrome at Fessenheim, during the visit \\noffered to the journalists by the EDF (French Electric Company), to repeat on this \\noccasion the accident linked to the magic eye, to the provocative presence of the media. \\nAlas, nothing happened. And on the other hand yes! so powerful is the logic of simulacra: \\na week after, the unions discovered fissures in the reactors. Miracle of contagions, \\nmiracle of analogic chain reactions. \\n\\nThus, the essence of the film is not in any respect the Watergate effect in the person of \\nJane Fonda, not in any respect TV as a means of exposing nuclear vices, but on the \\ncontrary TV as the twin orbit and twin chain reaction of the nuclear one. Besides, just at \\nthe end - and there the film is unrelenting in Regard to its own argument - when Jane \\nFonda makes the truth explode directly (maximum Watergate effect), her image is \\njuxtaposed with what will inexorably follow it and efface it on the screen: a commercial \\nof some kind. The Network effect goes far beyond the Watergate effect and spreads \\nmysteriously into the Harrisburg effect, that is to say not into the nuclear threat, but into \\nthe simulation of nuclear catastrophe. \\n\\nSo, it is simulation that is effective, never the real. The simulation of nuclear catastrophe \\nis the strategic result of this generic and universal undertaking of deterrence: accustoming \\nthe people to the ideology and the discipline of absolute security - to the metaphysics of \\nfission and fissure. To this end the fissure must be a fiction. A real catastrophe would \\ndelay things, it would constitute a retrograde incident, of the explosive kind (without \\nchanging the course of things: did Hiroshima perceptibly delay, deter, the universal \\nprocess of deterrence?). \\n\\nIn the film, also, real fusion would be a bad argument: the film would regress to the level \\nof a disaster movie - weak by definition, because it means returning things to their pure \\nevent. The China Syndrome, itself, finds its strength in filtering catastrophe, in the \\ndistillation of the nuclear specter through the omnipresent hertzian relays of information. \\nIt teaches us (once again without meaning to) that nuclear catastrophe does not occur, is \\nnot meant to happen, in the real either, any more than the atomic clash was at the \\ndawning of the cold war. The equilibrium of terror rests on the eternal deferral of the \\natomic clash. The atom and the nuclear are made to be disseminated for deterrent ends, \\nthe power of catastrophe must, instead of stupidly exploding, be disseminated in \\nhomeopathic, molecular doses, in the continuous reservoirs of information. Therein lies \\nthe true contamination: never biological and radioactive, but, rather, a mental \\ndestructuration through a mental strategy of catastrophe. \\n\\nIf one looks carefully, the film introduces us to this mental strategy, and in going further, \\nit even delivers a lesson diametrically opposed to that of Watergate: if every strategy \\ntoday is that of mental terror and of deterrence tied to the suspension and the eternal \\nsimulation of catastrophe, then the only means of mitigating this scenario would be to \\nmake the catastrophe arrive, to produce or to reproduce a real catastrophe. To which \\nNature is at times given: in its inspired moments, it is God who through his cataclysms \\nunknots the equilibrium of terror in which humans are imprisoned. Closer to us, this is \\nwhat terrorism is occupied with as well: making real, palpable violence surface in \\nopposition to the invisible violence of security. Besides, therein lies terrorism\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\nambiguity. \\n\\n* NOTE * \\n\\n1. The incident at the nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island, which will shortly follow the \\nrelease of the film. \\n\\n\\n\\nAPOCALYPSE NOW \\n\\n\\nCoppola makes his film like the Americans made war - in this sense, it is the best \\npossible testimonial - with the same immoderation, the same excess of means, the same \\nmonstrous candor . . . and the same success. The war as entrenchment, as technological \\nand psychedelic fantasy, the war as a succession of special effects, the war become film \\neven before being filmed. The war abolishes itself in its technological test, and for \\nAmericans it was primarily that: a test site, a gigantic territory in which to test their arms, \\ntheir methods, their power. Coppola does nothing but that: test cinema\\'s power of \\nintervention, test the impact of a cinema that has become an immeasurable machinery of \\nspecial effects. In this sense, his film is really the extension of the war through other \\nmeans, the pinnacle of this failed war, and its apotheosis. The war became film, the film \\nbecomes war, the two are joined by their common hemorrhage into technology. \\n\\nThe real war is waged by Coppola as it is by Westmoreland: without counting the \\ninspired irony of having forests and Phillipine villages napalmed to retrace the hell of \\nSouth Vietnam. One revisits everything through cinema and one begins again: the \\nMolochian joy of filming, the sacrificial joy of so many millions spent, of such a \\nholocaust of means, of so many misadventures, and the remarkable paranoia that from the \\nbeginning conceived of this film as a historical, global event, in which, in the mind of the \\ncreator, the war in Vietnam would have been nothing other than what it is, would not \\nfundamentally have existed - and it is necessary for us to believe in this: the war in \\nVietnam \"in itself\" perhaps in fact never happened, it is a dream, a baroque dream of \\nnapalm and of the tropics, a psychotropic dream that had the goal neither of a victory nor \\nof a policy at stake, but, rather, the sacrificial, excessive deployment of a power already \\nfilming itself as it unfolded, perhaps waiting for nothing but consecration by a superfilm, \\nwhich completes the mass-spectacle effect of this war. \\n\\nNo real distance, no critical sense, no desire for \"raising consciousness\" in relation to the \\nwar: and in a sense this is the brutal quality of this film - not being rotten with the moral \\npsychology of war. Coppola can certainly deck out his helicopter captain in a ridiculous \\nhat of the light cavalry, and make him crush the Vietnamese village to the sound of \\nWagner\\'s music - those are not critical, distant signs, they are immersed in the machinery, \\nthey are part of the special effect, and he himself makes movies in the same way, with the \\nsame retro megalomania, and the same non-signifying furor, with the same clownish \\neffect in overdrive. But there it is, he hits us with that, it is there, it is bewildering, and \\none can say to oneself: how is such a horror possible (not that of the war, but that of the \\nfilm strictly speaking)? But there is no answer, there is no possible verdict, and one can \\neven rejoice in this monstrous trick (exactly as with Wagner) - but one can always \\nretrieve a tiny little idea that is not nasty, that is not a value judgment, but that tells you \\nthe war in Vietnam and this film are cut from the same cloth, that nothing separates them, \\nthat this film is part of the war - if the Americans (seemingly) lost the other one, they \\ncertainly won this one. Apocalypse Now is a global victory. Cinematographic power \\nequal and superior to that of the industrial and military complexes, equal or superior to \\nthat of the Pentagon and of governments. \\n\\nAnd all of a sudden, the film is not without interest: it retrospectively illuminates (not \\n\\n\\neven retrospectively, because the film is a phase of this war without end) what was \\nalready crazy about this war, irrational in political terms: the Americans and the \\nVietnamese are already reconciled, right after the end of the hostilities the Americans \\noffered economic aid, exactly as if they had annihilated the jungle and the towns, exactly \\nas they are making their film today. One has understood nothing, neither about the war \\nnor about cinema (at least the latter) if one has not grasped this lack of distinction that is \\nno longer either an ideological or a moral one, one of good and evil, but one of the \\nreversibility of both destruction and production, of the immanence of a thing in its very \\nrevolution, of the organic metabolism of all the technologies, of the carpet of bombs in \\nthe strip of film . . . \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BEAUBOURG EFFECT: IMPLOSION AND DETERRENCE \\n\\n\\nThe Beaubourg effect, the Beaubourg machine, the Beaubourg thing - how to give it a \\nname? Enigma of this carcass of flux and signs, of networks and circuits - the final \\nimpulse to translate a structure that no longer has a name, the structure of social relations \\ngiven over to superficial ventilation (animation, self-management, information, media) \\nand to an irreversibly deep implosion. Monument to the games of mass simulation, the \\nPompidou Center functions as an incinerator absorbing all the cultural energy and \\ndevouring it - a bit like the black monolith in 2001: insane convection of all the contents \\nthat came there to be materialized, to be absorbed, and to be annihilated. All around, the \\nneighborhood is nothing but a protective zone - remodeling, disinfection, a snobbish and \\nhygienic design - but above all in a figurative sense: it is a machine for making \\nemptiness. It is a bit like the real danger nuclear power stations pose: not lack of security, \\npollution, explosion, but a system of maximum security that radiates around them, the \\nprotective zone of control and deterrence that extends, slowly but surely, over the \\nterritory - a technical, ecological, economic, geopolitical glacis. What does the nuclear \\nmatter? The station is a matrix in which an absolute model of security is elaborated, \\nwhich will encompass the whole social field, and which is fundamentally a model of \\ndeterrence (it is the same one that controls us globally, under the sign of peaceful \\ncoexistence and of the simulation of atomic danger). \\n\\nThe same model, with the same proportions, is elaborated at the Center: cultural fission, \\npolitical deterrence. \\n\\nThis said, the circulation of fluids is unequal. Ventilation, cooling, electrical networks - \\nthe \"traditional\" fluids circulate there very well. Already the circulation of the human \\nflux is less assured (the archaic solution of escalators in plastic sleeves, one ought to be \\naspirated, propelled, or something, but with a mobility that would be up to this baroque \\ntheatricality of fluids that is the source of the originality of the carcass). As for the \\nmaterial of the works, of objects, of books and the so-called polyvalent interior space, \\nthese no longer circulate at all. It is the opposite of Roissy, where from a futurist center \\nof \"spatial\" design radiating toward \"satellites,\" etc., one ends up completely flat in front \\nof . . . traditional airplanes. But the incoherence is the same. (What happened to money, \\nthis other fluid, what happened to its mode of circulation, of emulsion, of fallout at \\nBeaubourg?) \\n\\nSame contradiction even in the behavior of the personnel, assigned to the \"polyvalent\" \\nspace and without a private work space. On their feet and mobile, the people affect a cool \\ndemeanor, more supple, very contemporary, adapted to the \"structure\" of a \"modern\" \\nspace. Seated in their corner, which is precisely not one, they exhaust themselves \\nsecreting an artificial solitude, remaking their \"bubble.\" Therein is also a great tactic of \\ndeterrence: one condemns them to using all their energy in this individual defense. \\nCuriously, one thus finds the same contradiction that characterizes the Beaubourg thing: \\na mobile exterior, commuting, cool and modern - an interior shriveled by the same old \\nvalues. \\n\\nThis space of deterrence, articulated on the ideology of visibility, of transparency, of \\n\\n\\npolyvalency, of consensus and contact, and sanctioned by the blackmail to security, is \\ntoday, virtually, that of all social relations. All of social discourse is there, and on this \\nlevel as well as on that of the treatment of culture, Beaubourg flagrantly contradicts its \\nexplicit objectives, a nice monument to our modernity. It is nice to think that the idea did \\nnot come to some revolutionary spirit, but to the logicians of the established order, \\ndeprived of all critical intelligence, and thus closer to the truth, capable, in their \\nobstinacy, of putting in place a machine that is fundamentally uncontrollable, that in its \\nvery success escapes them, and that is the most exact reflection, even in its \\ncontradictions, of the current state of things. \\n\\nCertainly, all the cultural contents of Beaubourg are anachronistic, because only an \\nempty interior could correspond to this architectural envelope. The general impression \\nbeing that everything here has come out of a coma, that everything wants to be animation \\nand is only reanimation, and that this is good because culture is dead, a condition that \\nBeaubourg admirably retraces, but in a dishonest fashion, whereas one should have \\ntriumphantly accepted this death and erected a monument or an anti-monument \\nequivalent to the phallic inanity of the Eiffel Tower in its time. Monument to total \\ndisconnection, to hyperreality and to the implosion of culture-achieved today for us in the \\neffect of transistorized circuits always threatened by a gigantic short circuit. \\n\\nBeaubourg is already an imperial compression - figure of a culture already crushed by its \\nown weight - like moving automobiles suddenly frozen in a geometric solid. Like the cars \\nof Caesar, survivors of an ideal accident, no longer external, but internal to the metallic \\nand mechanical structure, and which would have produced tons of cubic scrap iron, \\nwhere the chaos of tubes, levers, frames, of metal and human flesh inside is tailored to \\nthe geometric size of the smallest possible space - thus the culture of Beaubourg is \\nground, twisted, cut up, and pressed into its smallest simple elements - a bundle of \\ndefunct transmissions and metabolisms, frozen like a science-fiction mecanoid. \\n\\nBut instead of breaking and compressing all culture here in this carcass that in any case \\nhas the appearance of a compression, instead of that, one exhibits Caesar there. One \\nexhibits Dubuffet and the counterculture, whose inverse simulation acts as a referential \\nfor the defunct culture. In this carcass that could have served as a mausoleum to the \\nuseless operationality of signs, one reexhibits Tinguely\\'s ephemeral and autodestructive \\nmachines under the sign of the eternity of culture. Thus one neutralizes everything \\ntogether: Tinguely is embalmed in the museal institution, Beaubourg falls back on its \\nsupposed artistic contents. \\n\\nFortunately, this whole simulacrum of cultural values is annihilated in advance by the \\nexternal architecture.*! Because this architecture, with its networks of tubes and the look \\nit has of being an expo or world\\'s fair building, with its (calculated?) fragility deterring \\nany traditional mentality or monumentality, overtly proclaims that our time will never \\nagain be that of duration, that our only temporality is that of the accelerated cycle and of \\nrecycling, that of the circuit and of the transit of fluids. Our only culture in the end is that \\nof hydrocarbons, that of refining, cracking, breaking cultural molecules and of their \\nrecombination into synthesized products. This, the Beaubourg Museum wishes to \\nconceal, but the Beaubourg cadaver proclaims. And this is what underlies the beauty of \\nthe cadaver and the failure of the interior spaces. In any case, the very ideology of \\n\\n\\n\\n\"cultural production\" is antithetical to all culture, as is that of visibility and of the \\npolyvalent space: culture is a site of the secret, of seduction, of initiation, of a restrained \\nand highly ritualized symbolic exchange. Nothing can be done about it. Too bad for the \\nmasses, too bad for Beaubourg. \\n\\nWhat should, then, have been placed in Beaubourg? \\n\\nNothing. The void that would have signified the disappearance of any culture of meaning \\nand aesthetic sentiment. But\\'this is still too romantic and destructive, this void would still \\nhave had value as a masterpiece of anticulture. \\n\\nPerhaps revolving strobe lights and gyroscopic lights, striating the space, for which the \\ncrowd would have provided the moving base element? \\n\\nIn fact, Beaubourg illustrates very well that an order of simulacra only establishes itself \\non the alibi of the previous order. Here, a cadaver all in flux and surface connections \\ngives itself as content a traditional culture of depth. An order of prior simulacra (that of \\nmeaning) furnishes the empty substance of a subsequent order, which, itself, no longer \\neven knows the distinction between signifier and signified, nor between form and \\ncontent. \\n\\nThe question: \"What should have been placed in Beaubourg?\" is thus absurd. It cannot be \\nanswered because the topical distinction between interior and exterior should no longer \\nbe posed. There lies our truth, the truth of Mobius-doubtless an unrealizable Utopia, but \\nwhich Beaubourg still points to as right, to the degree to which any of its contents is a \\ncountermeaning and annihilated in advance by the form. \\n\\nYet-yet... if you had to have something in Beaubourg - it should have been a labyrinth, a \\ncombinatory, infinite library, an aleatory redistribution of destinies through games or \\nlotteries - in short, the universe of Borges - or even the circular Ruins: the slowed-down \\nenchainment of individuals dreamed up by each other (not a dreamworld Disneyland, a \\nlaboratory of practical fiction). An experimentation with all the different processes of \\nrepresentation: defraction, implosion, slow motion, aleatory linkage and decoupling - a \\nbit like at the Exploratorium in San Francisco or in the novels of Philip K. Dick - in short \\na culture of simulation and of fascination, and not always one of production and meaning: \\nthis is what might be proposed that would not be a miserable anticulture. Is it possible? \\nNot here, evidently. But this culture takes place elsewhere, everywhere, nowhere. From \\ntoday, the only real cultural practice, that of the masses, ours (there is no longer a \\ndifference), is a manipulative, aleatory practice, a labyrinthine practice of signs, and one \\nthat no longer has any meaning. \\n\\nIn another way, however, it is not true that there is no coherence between form and \\ncontent at Beaubourg. It is true if one gives any credence to the official cultural project. \\nBut exactly the opposite occurs there. Beaubourg is nothing but a huge effort to \\ntransmute this famous traditional culture of meaning into the aleatory order of signs, into \\nan order of simulacra (the third) that is completely homogeneous with the flux and pipes \\nof the facade. And it is in order to prepare the masses for this new semiurgic order that \\none brings them together here - with the opposite pretext of acculturating them to \\n\\n\\n\\nmeaning and depth. \\n\\n\\nOne must thus start with this axiom: Beaubourg is a monument of cultural deterrence. \\nWithin a museal scenario that only serves to keep up the humanist fiction of culture, it is \\na veritable fashioning of the death of culture that takes place, and it is a veritable cultural \\nmourning for which the masses are joyously gathered. \\n\\nAnd they throw themselves at it. There lies the supreme irony of Beaubourg: the masses \\nthrow themselves at it not because they salivate for that culture which they have been \\ndenied for centuries, but because they have for the first time the opportunity to massively \\nparticipate in this great mourning of a culture that, in the end, they have always detested. \\n\\nThe misunderstanding is therefore complete when one denounces Beaubourg as a cultural \\nmystification of the masses. The masses, themselves, rush there to enjoy this execution, \\nthis dismemberment, this operational prostitution of a culture finally truly liquidated, \\nincluding all counterculture that is nothing but its apotheosis. The masses rush toward \\nBeaubourg as they rush toward disaster sites, with the same irresistible elan. Better: they \\nare the disaster of Beaubourg. Their number, their stampede, their fascination, their itch \\nto see everything is objectively a deadly and catastrophic behavior for the whole \\nundertaking. Not only does their weight put the building in danger, but their adhesion, \\ntheir curiosity annihilates the very contents of this culture of animation. This rush can no \\nlonger be measured against what was proposed as the cultural objective, it is its radical \\nnegation, in both its excess and success. It is thus the masses who assume the role of \\ncatastrophic agent in this structure of catastrophe, it is the masses themselves who put an \\nend to mass culture. \\n\\nCirculating in the space of transparency, the masses are certainly converted into flux, but \\nat the same time, through their opacity and inertia, they put an end to this \"polyvalent\" \\nspace. One invites the masses to participate, to simulate, to play with the models - they \\ngo one better: they participate and manipulate so well that they efface all the meaning \\none wants to give to the operation and put the very infrastructure of the edifice in danger. \\nThus, always a sort of parody, a hypersimulation in response to cultural simulation, \\ntransforms the masses, who should only be the livestock of culture, into the agents of the \\nexecution of this culture, of which Beaubourg was only the shameful incarnation. \\n\\nOne must applaud this success of cultural deterrence. All the antiartists, leftists, and those \\nwho hold culture in contempt have never even gotten close to approaching the \\ndissuassive efficacy of this monumental black hole that is Beaubourg. It is a truly \\nrevolutionary operation, precisely because it is involuntary, insane and uncontrolled, \\nwhereas any operation meant to put an end to culture only serves, as one knows, to \\nresurrect it. \\n\\nTo tell the truth, the only content of Beaubourg is the masses themselves, whom the \\nbuilding treats like a converter, like a black box, or, in terms of input-output, just like a \\nrefinery handles petroleum products or a flood of unprocessed material. \\n\\nIt has never been so clear that the content - here, culture, elsewhere, information or \\ncommodities - is nothing but the phantom support for the operation of the medium itself, \\n\\n\\n\\nwhose function is always to induce mass, to produce a homogeneous human and mental \\nflux. An immense to-and-fro movement similar to that of suburban commuters, absorbed \\nand ejected at fixed times by their workplace. And it is precisely work that is at issue here \\n- a work of testing, polling, and directed interrogation: the people come here to select \\nobjects - responses to all the questions they might ask themselves, or rather they come \\nthemselves in response to the functional and directed question that the objects constitute. \\nMore than a chain of work it is thus a question of a programmatic discipline whose \\nconstraints have been effaced behind a veneer of tolerance. Well beyond traditional \\ninstitutions of capital, the hypermarket, or the Beaubourg \"hypermarket of culture,\" is \\nalready the model of all future forms of controlled socialization: retotalization in a \\nhomogeneous space - time of all the dispersed functions of the body and of social life \\n(work, leisure, media culture), retranscription of all the contradictory currents in terms of \\nintegrated circuits. Space-time of a whole operational simulation of social life. \\n\\nFor that, the mass of consumers must be equivalent or homologous to the mass of \\nproducts. It is the confrontation and the fusion of these two masses that occurs in the \\nhypermarket as it does at Beaubourg, and that makes of them something very different \\nfrom the traditional sites of culture (monuments, museums, galleries, libraries, \\ncommunity arts centers, etc.). Here a critical mass beyond which the commodity becomes \\nhypercommodity and culture hyperculture, is elaborated - that is to say no longer linked \\nto distinct exchanges or determined needs, but to a kind of total descriptive universe, or \\nintegrated circuit that implosion traverses through and through - incessant circulation of \\nchoices, readings, references, marks, decoding. Here cultural objects, as elsewhere the \\nobjects of consumption, have no other end than to maintain you in a state of mass \\nintegration, of transistorized flux, of a magnetized molecule. It is what one comes to leam \\nin a hypermarket: hyperreality of the commodity - it is what one comes to leam at \\nBeaubourg: the hyperreality of culture. \\n\\nAlready with the traditional museum this cutting up, this regrouping, this interference of \\nall cultures, this unconditional aestheticization that constitutes the hyperreality of culture \\nbegins, but the museum is still a memory. Never, as it did here, has culture lost its \\nmemory in the service of stockpiling and functional redistribution. And this translates a \\nmore general fact: that throughout the \"civilized\" world the construction of stockpiles of \\nobjects has brought with it the complementary process of stockpiles of people - the line, \\nwaiting, traffic jams, concentration, the camp. That is \"mass production,\" not in the sense \\nof a massive production or for use by the masses, but the production of the masses. The \\nmasses as the final product of all sociality, and, at the same time, as putting an end to \\nsociality, because these masses that one wants us to believe are the social, are on the \\ncontrary the site of the implosion of the social. The masses are the increasingly dense \\nsphere in which the whole social comes to be imploded, and to be devoured in an \\nuninterrupted process of simulation. \\n\\nWhence this concave mirror: it is from seeing the masses in the interior that the masses \\nwill be tempted to rush in. Typical marketing method: the whole ideology of \\ntransparency here takes on its meaning. Or again: it is in staging a reduced ideal model \\nthat one hopes for an accelerated gravitation, an automatic agglutination of culture as an \\nautomatic agglomeration of the masses. Same process: nuclear operation of a chain \\nreaction, or specular operation of white magic. \\n\\n\\n\\nThus for the first time, Beaubourg is at the level of culture what the hypermarket is at the \\nlevel of the commodity: the perfect circulatory operator, the demonstration of anything \\n(commodity, culture, crowd, compressed air) through its own accelerated circulation. \\n\\nBut if the supply of objects brings along with it the stockpiling of men, the latent \\nviolence in the supply of objects brings with it the inverse violence of men. \\n\\nEvery stock is violent, and there is a specific violence in any mass of men also, because \\nof the fact that it implodes - a violence proper to its gravitation, to its densification \\naround its own locus of inertia. The masses are a locus of inertia and through that a locus \\nof a completely new, inexplicable violence different from explosive violence. \\n\\nCritical mass, implosive mass. Beyond thirty thousand it poses the risk of \"bending\" the \\nstructure of Beaubourg. If the masses magnetized by the structure become a destructive \\nvariable of the structure itself - if those who conceived of the project wanted this (but \\nhow to hope for this?), if they thus programmed the chance of putting an end with one \\nblow to both architecture and culture - then Beaubourg constitutes the most audacious \\nobject and the most successful happening of the century! \\n\\nMake Beaubourg bend! New motto of a revolutionary order. Useless to set fire to it, \\nuseless to contest it. Do it! It is the best way of destroying it. The success of Beaubourg is \\nno longer a mystery: the people go there for that, they throw themselves on this building, \\nwhose fragility already breathes catastrophe, with the single goal of making it bend. \\n\\nCertainly they obey the imperative of deterrence: one gives them an object to consume, a \\nculture to devour, an edifice to manipulate. But at the same time they expressly aim, and \\nwithout knowing it, at this annihilation. The onslaught is the only act the masses can \\nproduce as such - a projectile mass that challenges the edifice of mass culture, that wittly \\nreplies with its weight (that is to say with the characteristic most deprived of meaning, \\nthe stupidest, the least cultural one they possess) to the challenge of culturality thrown at \\nit by Beaubourg. To the challenge of mass acculturation to a sterili z ed culture, the masses \\nrespond with a destructive irruption, which is prolonged in a brutal manipulation. To \\nmental deterrence the masses respond with a direct physical deterrence. It is their own \\nchallenge. Their ruse, which is to respond in the very terms by which they are solicited, \\nbut beyond that, to respond to the simulation in which one imprisions them with an \\nenthusiastic social process that surpasses the objectives of the former and acts as a \\ndestructive hypersimulation.*2 \\n\\nPeople have the desire to take everything, to pillage everything, to swallow everything, to \\nmanipulate everything. Seeing, deciphering, learning does not touch them. The only \\nmassive affect is that of manipulation. The organizers (and the artists and intellectuals) \\nare frightened by this uncontrollable watchfulness, because they never count on anything \\nbut the apprenticeship of the masses to the spectacle of culture. They never count on this \\nactive, destructive fascination, a brutal and original response to the gift of an \\nincomprehensible culture, an attraction that has all the characteristics of breaking and \\nentering and of the violation of a sanctuary. \\n\\n\\n\\nBeaubourg could have or should have disappeared the day after the inauguration, \\ndismantled and kidnapped by the crowd, which would have been the only possible \\nresponse to the absurd challenge of the transparency and democracy of culture - each \\nperson taking away a fetishized bolt of this culture itself fetishized. \\n\\nThe people come to touch, they look as if they were touching, their gaze is only an aspect \\nof tactile manipulation. It is certainly a question of a tactile universe, no longer a visual \\nor discursive one, and the people are directly implicated in a process: to manipulate/to be \\nmanipulated, to ventilate/to be ventilated, to circulate/to make circulate, which is no \\nlonger of the order of representation, nor of distance, nor of reflection. It is something \\nthat is part of panic, and of a world in panic. \\n\\nPanic in slow motion, no external variable. It is the violence internal to a saturated \\nensemble. Implosion. \\n\\nBeaubourg cannot even bum, everything is foreseen. Fire, explosion, destruction are no \\nlonger the imaginary alternative to this type of building. It is implosion that is the form of \\nabolishing the \"quaternary\" world, both cybernetic and combinatory. \\n\\nSubversion, violent destruction is what corresponds to a mode of production. To a \\nuniverse of networks, of combinatory theory, and of flow correspond reversal and \\nimplosion. \\n\\nThe same for institutions, the state, power, etc. The dream of seeing all that explode by \\ndint of contradictions is precisely nothing but a dream. What is produced in reality is that \\nthe institutions implode of themselves, by dint of ramifications, feedback, overdeveloped \\ncontrol circuits. Power implodes, this is its current mode of disappearance. \\n\\nSuch is the case for the city. Fires, war, plague, revolutions, criminal marginality, \\ncatastrophes: the whole problematic of the anticity, of the negativity internal or external \\nto the city, has some archaic relation to its true mode of annihilation. \\n\\nEven the scenario of the underground city - the Chinese version of the burial of structures \\n- is naive. The city does not repeat itself any longer according to a schema of \\nreproduction still dependent on the general schema of production, or according to a \\nschema of resemblance still dependent on a schema of representation. (That is how one \\nstill restored after the Second World War.) The city no longer revives, even deep down - \\nit is remade starting from a sort of genetic code that makes it possible to repeat it \\nindefinitely starting with an accumulated cybernetic memory. Gone even the Borgesian \\nUtopia, of the map coextensive with the territory and doubling it in its entirety: today the \\nsimulacrum no longer goes by way of the double and of duplication, but by way of \\ngenetic miniaturization. End of representation and implosion, there also, of the whole \\nspace in an infinitesimal memory, which forgets nothing, and which belongs to no one. \\nSimulation of an immanent, increasingly dense, irreversible order, one that is potentially \\nsaturated and that will never again witness the liberating explosion. \\n\\nWe were a culture of liberating violence (rationality). Whether it be that of capital, of the \\nliberation of productive forces, of the irreversible extension of the field of reason and of \\n\\n\\n\\nthe field of value, of the conquered and colonized space including the universal - whether \\nit be that of the revolution, which anticipates the future forms of the social and of the \\nenergy of the social - the schema is the same: that of an expanding sphere, whether \\nthrough slow or violent phases, that of a liberated energy - the imaginary of radiation. \\n\\nThe violence that accompanies it is that of a wider world: it is that of production. This \\nviolence is dialectical, energetic, cathartic. It is the one we have learned to analyze and \\nthat is familiar to us: that which traces the paths of the social and which leads to the \\nsaturation of the whole field of the social. It is a violence that is determined, analytical, \\nliberating. \\n\\nA whole other violence appears today, which we no longer know how to analyze, \\nbecause it escapes the traditional schema of explosive violence: implosive violence that \\nno longer results from the extension of a system, but from its saturation and its retraction, \\nas is the case for physical stellar systems. A violence that follows an inordinate \\ndensifkation of the social, the state of an overregulated system, a network (of knowledge, \\ninformation, power) that is overencumbered, and of a hypertrophic control investing all \\nthe interstitial pathways. \\n\\nThis violence is unintelligible to us because our whole imaginary has as its axis the logic \\nof expanding systems. It is indecipherable because undetermined. Perhaps it no longer \\neven comes from the schema of indeterminacy. Because the aleatory models that have \\ntaken over from classical models of determination and causality are not fundamentally \\ndifferent. They translate the passage of defined systems of expansion to systems of \\nproduction and expansion on all levels - in a star or in a rhizome, it doesn\\'t matter - all \\nthe philosophies of the release of energy, of the irradiation of intensities and of the \\nmolecularization of desire go in the same direction, that of a saturation as far as the \\ninterstitial and the infinity of networks. The difference from the molar to the molecular is \\nonly a modulation, the last perhaps, in the fundamental energetic process of expanding \\nsystems. \\n\\nSomething else if we move from a millennial phase of the liberation and disconnection of \\nenergies to a phase of implosion, after a kind of maximum radiation (see Bataille\\'s \\nconcepts of loss and expenditure in this sense, and the solar myth of an inexhaustible \\nradiation, on which he founds his sumptuary anthropology: it is the last explosive and \\nradiating myth of our philosophy, the last fire of artifice of a fundamentally general \\neconomy, but this no longer has any meaning for us), to a phase of the reversion of the \\nsocial - gigantic reversion of a field once the point of saturation is reached. The stellar \\nsystems also do not cease to exist once their radiating energy is dissipated: they implode \\naccording to a process that is at first slow, and then progressively accelerates - they \\ncontract at a fabulous speed, and become involutive systems, which absorb all the \\nsurrounding energies, so that they become black holes where the world as we know it, as \\nradiation and indefinite energy potential, is abolished. \\n\\nPerhaps the great metropolises - certainly these if this hypothesis has any meaning - have \\nbecome sites of implosion in this sense, sites of the absorption and reabsorption of the \\nsocial itself whose golden age, contemporaneous with the double concept of capital and \\nrevolution, is doubtless past. The social involutes slowly or brutally, in a field of inertia, \\n\\n\\n\\nwhich already envelops the political. (The opposite energy?) One must stop oneself from \\ntaking implosion for a negative process -inert, regressive - like the one language imposes \\non us by exalting the opposite terms of evolution, of revolution. Implosion is a process \\nspecific to incalculable consequences. May 1968 was without a doubt the first implosive \\nepisode, that is to say contrary to its rewriting in terms of revolutionary prosopopeia, a \\nfirst violent reaction to the saturation of the social, a retraction, a challenge to the \\nhegemony of the social, in contradiction, moreover, to the ideology of the participants \\nthemselves, who thought they were going further into the social - such is the imaginary \\nthat still dominates us - and moreover a good part of the events of 1968 were still able to \\ncome from that revolutionary dynamic and explosive violence, but something else began \\nat the same time there: the violent involution of the social, determined on that score, and \\nthe consecutive and sudden implosion of power, in a brief moment of time, but that never \\nstopped afterward - fundamentally it is that which continues, the implosion, of the social, \\nof institutions, of power - and not at all an unlocatable revolutionary dynamic. On the \\ncontrary, revolution itself, the idea of revolution also implodes, and this implosion carries \\nweightier consequences than the revolution itself. \\n\\nCertainly, since 1968, and thanks to 1968, the social, like the desert, grows-participation, \\nmanagement, generalized self-management, etc. - but at the same time it comes close in \\nmultiple places, more numerous than in 1968, to its disaffection and to its total reversion. \\nSlow seism, intelligible to historical reason. \\n\\n* NOTES * \\n\\n1. Still something else annihilates the cultural project of Beaubourg: the masses \\nthemselves also flood in to take pleasure in it (we will return to this later). \\n\\n2. In relation to this critical mass, and to its radical understanding of Beaubourg, how \\nderisory seems the demonstration of the students from Vincennes the evening of its \\ninauguration! \\n\\n\\n\\nHYPERMARKET AND HYPERCOMMODITY \\n\\n\\nFrom thirty kilometers all around, the arrows point you toward these large triage centers \\nthat are the hypermarkets, toward this hyperspace of the commodity where in many \\nregards a whole new sociality is elaborated. It remains to be seen how the hypermarket \\ncentralizes and redistributes a whole region and population, how it concentrates and \\nrationalizes time, trajectories, practices - creating an immense to-and-fro movement \\ntotally similar to that of suburban commuters, absorbed and ejected at fixed times by their \\nwork place. \\n\\nAt the deepest level, another kind of work is at issue here, the work of acculturation, of \\nconfrontation, of examination, of the social code, and of the verdict: people go there to \\nfind and to select objects - responses to all the questions they may ask themselves; or, \\nrather, they themselves come in response to the functional and directed question that the \\nobjects constitute. The objects are no longer commodities: they are no longer even signs \\nwhose meaning and message one could decipher and appropriate for oneself, they are \\ntests, they are the ones that interrogate us, and we are summoned to answer them, and the \\nanswer is included in the question. Thus all the messages in the media function in a \\nsimilar fashion: neither information nor communication, but referendum, perpetual test, \\ncircular response, verification of the code. \\n\\nNo relief, no perspective, no vanishing point where the gaze might risk losing itself, but a \\ntotal screen where, in their uninterrupted display, the billboards and the products \\nthemselves act as equivalent and successive signs. There are employees who are \\noccupied solely in remaking the front of the stage, the surface display, where a previous \\ndeletion by a consumer might have left some kind of a hole. The self-service also adds to \\nthis absence of depth: the same homogeneous space, without mediation, brings together \\nmen and things - a space of direct manipulation. But who manipulates whom? \\n\\nEven repression is integrated as a sign in this universe of simulation. Repression become \\ndeterrence is nothing but an extra sign in the universe of persuasion. The circuits of \\nsurveillance cameras are themselves part of the decor of simulacra. A perfect surveillance \\non all fronts would require a heavier and more sophisticated mechanism of control than \\nthat of the store itself. It would not be profitable. It is thus an allusion to repression, a \\n\"signal\" of this order, that is put in place; this sign can thus coexist with all the others, \\nand even with the opposite imperative, for example those that huge billboards express by \\ninviting you to relax and to choose in complete serenity. These billboards, in fact, \\nobserve and surveil you as well, or as badly, as the \"policing\" television. The latter looks \\nat you, you look at yourself in it, mixed with the others, it is the mirror without silvering \\n(tain) in the activity of consumption, a game of splitting in two and doubling that closes \\nthis world on itself. \\n\\nThe hypermarket cannot be separated from the highways that surround and feed it, from \\nthe parking lots blanketed in automobiles, from the computer terminal - further still, in \\nconcentric circles - from the whole town as a total functional screen of activities. The \\nhypermarket resembles a giant montage factory, because, instead of being linked to the \\nchain of work by a continuous rational constraint, the agents (or the patients), mobile and \\n\\n\\ndecentered, give the impression of passing through aleatory circuits from one point of the \\nchain to another. Schedules, selection, buying are aleatory as well, in contrast to work \\npractices. But it is still a question of a chain, of a programmatic discipline, whose taboos \\nare effaced beneath a veneer of tolerance, facility, and hyperreality. The hypermarket is \\nalready, beyond the factory and traditional institutions of capital, the model of all future \\nforms of controlled socialization: retotalization in a homogeneous space - time of all the \\ndispersed functions of the body, and of social life (work, leisure, food, hygiene, \\ntransportation, media, culture); retranscription of the contradictory fluxes in terms of \\nintegrated circuits; space - time of a whole operational simulation of social life, of a \\nwhole structure of living and traffic. \\n\\nA model of directed anticipation, the hypermarket (especially in the United States) \\npreexists the metropolitan area; it is what gives rise to metro areas, whereas the \\ntraditional market was in the heart of a city, a place where the city and the country came \\nto rub elbows. The hypermarket is the expression of a whole lifestyle in which not only \\nthe country but the town as well have disappeared to make room for \"the metro area\" - a \\ncompletely delimited functional urban zoning, of which the hypermarket is the \\nequivalent, the micromodel, on the level of consumption. But the role of the hypermarket \\ngoes far beyond \"consumption,\" and the objects no longer have a specific reality there: \\nwhat is primary is their serial, circular, spectacular arrangement - the future model of \\nsocial relations. \\n\\nThe \"form\" hypermarket can thus help us understand what is meant by the end of \\nmodernity. The large cities have witnessed the birth, in about a century (1850-1950), of a \\ngeneration of large, \"modern\" stores (many carried this name in one way or another), but \\nthis fundamental modernization, linked to that of transportation, did not overthrow the \\nurban structure. The cities remained cities, whereas the new cities are satellited by the \\nhypermarket or the shopping center, serviced by a programmed traffic network, and cease \\nbeing cities to become metropolitan areas. A new morphogenesis has appeared, which \\ncomes from the cybernetic kind (that is to say, reproducing at the level of the territory, of \\nthe home, of transit, the scenarios of molecular control that are those of the genetic code), \\nand whose form is nuclear and satellitic. The hypermarket as nucleus. The city, even a \\nmodern one, no longer absorbs it. It is the hypermarket that establishes an orbit along \\nwhich suburbanizaiton moves. It functions as an implant for the new aggregates, as the \\nuniversity or even the factory sometimes also does - no longer the nineteenth-century \\nfactory nor the decentralized factory that, without breaking the orbit of the city, is \\ninstalled in the suburbs, but the montage factory, automated by electronic controls, that is \\nto say corresponding to a totally deterritorialized function and mode of work. With this \\nfactory, as with the hypermarket or the new university, one is no longer dealing with \\nfunctions (commerce, work, knowledge, leisure) that are autonomized and displaced \\n(which still characterizes the \"modern\" unfolding of the city), but with a model of the \\ndisintegration of functions, of the indeterminacy of functions, and of the disintegration of \\nthe city itself, which is transplanted outside the city and treated as a hyperreal model, as \\nthe nucleus of a metropolitan area based on synthesis that no longer has anything to do \\nwith a city. Negative satellites of the city that translate the end of the city, even of the \\nmodern city, as a determined, qualitative space, as an original synthesis of a society. \\n\\n\\nOne could believe that this implantation corresponds to the rationalization of diverse \\n\\n\\n\\nfunctions. But, in fact, from the moment a function becomes hyperspecialized to the point \\nof being capable of being projected from every element on the terrain \"keys in hand,\" it \\nloses the finality proper to it and becomes something else altogether: a polyfunctional \\nnucleus, an ensemble of \"black boxes\" with multiple input-outputs, the locus of \\nconvection and of destructuration. These factories and these universities are no longer \\nfactories nor universities, and the hypermarkets no longer have the quality of a market. \\nStrange new objects of which the nuclear power station is without a doubt the absolute \\nmodel and from which radiates a kind of neutralization of the territory, a power of \\ndeterrence that, behind the apparent function of these objects, without a doubt constitutes \\ntheir fundamental function: the hyperreality of functional nuclei that are no longer at all \\nfunctional. These new objects are the poles of simulation around which is elaborated, in \\ncontrast to old train stations, factories, or traditional transportation networks, something \\nother than a \"modernity\": a hyperreality, a simultaneity of all the functions, without a \\npast, without a future, an operationality on every level. And doubtless also crises, or even \\nnew catastrophes: May 1968 begins at Nanterre, and not at the Sorbonne, that is to say in \\na place where, for the first time in France, the hyperfunctionalization \"extra muros\" of a \\nplace of learning is equivalent to deterritorialization, to disaffection, to the loss of the \\nfunction and of the finality of knowledge in a programmed neofunctional whole. There, a \\nnew, original violence was born in response to the orbital satellization of a model \\n(knowledge, culture) whose referential is lost. \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE IMPLOSION OF MEANING IN THE MEDIA \\n\\n\\nWe live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning. \\nConsider three hypotheses. \\n\\nEither information produces meaning (a negentropic factor), but cannot make up for the \\nbrutal loss of signification in every domain. Despite efforts to reinject message and \\ncontent, meaning is lost and devoured faster than it can be reinjected. In this case, one \\nmust appeal to a base productivity to replace failing media. This is the whole ideology of \\nfree speech, of media broken down into innumerable individual cells of transmission, that \\nis, into \"antimedia\" (pirate radio, etc.). \\n\\nOr information has nothing to do with signification. It is something else, an operational \\nmodel of another order, outside meaning and of the circulation of meaning strictly \\nspeaking. This is Shannon\\'s hypothesis: a sphere of information that is purely functional, \\na technical medium that does not imply any finality of meaning, and thus should also not \\nbe implicated in a value judgment. A ki nd of code, like the genetic code: it is what it is, it \\nfunctions as it does, meaning is something else that in a sense comes after the fact, as it \\ndoes for Monod in Chance and Necessity. In this case, there would simply be no \\nsignificant relation between the inflation of information and the deflation of meaning. \\n\\nOr, very much on the contrary, there is a rigorous and necessary correlation between the \\ntwo, to the extent that information is directly destructive of meaning and signification, or \\nthat it neutralizes them. The loss of meaning is directly linked to the dissolving, \\ndissuasive action of information, the media, and the mass media. \\n\\nThe third hypothesis is the most interesting but flies in the face of every commonly held \\nopinion. Everywhere socialization is measured by the exposure to media messages. \\nWhoever is underexposed to the media is desocialized or virtually asocial. Everywhere \\ninformation is thought to produce an accelerated circulation of meaning, a plus value of \\nmeaning homologous to the economic one that results from the accelerated rotation of \\ncapital. Information is thought to create communication, and even if the waste is \\nenormous, a general consensus would have it that nevertheless, as a whole, there be an \\nexcess of meaning, which is redistributed in all the interstices of the social - just as \\nconsensus would have it that material production, despite its dysfunctions and \\nirrationalities, opens onto an excess of wealth and social purpose. We are all \\ncomplicitous in this myth. It is the alpha and omega of our modernity, without which the \\ncredibility of our social organization would collapse. Well, the fact is that it is collapsing, \\nand for this very reason: because where we think that information produces meaning, the \\nopposite occurs. \\n\\nInformation devours its own content. It devours communication and the social. And for \\ntwo reasons. \\n\\n1. Rather than creating communication, it exhausts itself in the act of staging \\ncommunication. Rather than producing meaning, it exhausts itself in the staging of \\n\\n\\nmeaning. A gigantic process of simulation that is very familiar. The nondirective \\ninterview, speech, listeners who call in, participation at every level, blackmail through \\nspeech: \"You are concerned, you are the event, etc.\" More and more information is \\ninvaded by this kind of phantom content, this homeopathic grafting, this awakening \\ndream of communication. A circular arrangement through which one stages the desire of \\nthe audience, the antitheater of communication, which, as one knows, is never anything \\nbut the recycling in the negative of the traditional institution, the integrated circuit of the \\nnegative. Immense energies are deployed to hold this simulacrum at bay, to avoid the \\nbrutal desimulation that would confront us in the face of the obvious reality of a radical \\nloss of meaning. \\n\\nIt is useless to ask if it is the loss of communication that produces this escalation in the \\nsimulacrum, or whether it is the simulacrum that is there first for dissuasive ends, to \\nshort-circuit in advance any possibility of communication (precession of the model that \\ncalls an end to the real). Useless to ask which is the first term, there is none, it is a \\ncircular process - that of simulation, that of the hyperreal. The hyperreality of \\ncommunication and of meaning. More real than the real, that is how the real is abolished. \\n\\nThus not only communication but the social functions in a closed circuit, as a lure - to \\nwhich the force of myth is attached. Belief, faith in information attach themselves to this \\ntautological proof that the system gives of itself by doubling the signs of an unlocatable \\nreality. \\n\\nBut one can believe that this belief is as ambiguous as that which was attached to myths \\nin ancient societies. One both believes and doesn\\'t. One does not ask oneself, \"I know \\nvery well, but still.\" A sort of inverse simulation in the masses, in each one of us, \\ncorresponds to this simulation of meaning and of communication in which this system \\nencloses us. To this tautology of the system the masses respond with ambivalence, to \\ndeterrence they respond with disaffection, or with an always enigmatic belief. Myth \\nexists, but one must guard against thinking that people believe in it: this is the trap of \\ncritical thinking that can only be exercised if it presupposes the naivete and stupidity of \\nthe masses. \\n\\n2. Behind this exacerbated mise-en-scene of communication, the mass media, the \\npressure of information pursues an irresistible destructuration of the social. \\n\\nThus information dissolves meaning and dissolves the social, in a sort of nebulous state \\ndedicated not to a surplus of innovation, but, on the contrary, to total entropy.* 1 \\n\\nThus the media are producers not of socialization, but of exactly the opposite, of the \\nimplosion of the social in the masses. And this is only the macroscopic extension of the \\nimplosion of meaning at the microscopic level of the sign. This implosion should be \\nanalyzed according to McLuhan\\'s formula, the medium is the message, the consequences \\nof which have yet to be exhausted. \\n\\nThat means that all contents of meaning are absorbed in the only dominant form of the \\nmedium. Only the medium can make an event - whatever the contents, whether they are \\nconformist or subversive. A serious problem for all counterinformation, pirate radios, \\n\\n\\n\\nantimedia, etc. But there is something even more serious, which McLuhan himself did \\nnot see. Because beyond this neutralization of all content, one could still expect to \\nmanipulate the medium in its form and to transform the real by using the impact of the \\nmedium as form. If all the content is wiped out, there is perhaps still a subversive, \\nrevolutionary use value of the medium as such. That is - and this is where McLuhan\\'s \\nformula leads, pushed to its limit - there is not only an implosion of the message in the \\nmedium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real, \\nthe implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even \\nthe definition and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined. \\n\\nEven the \"traditional\" status of the media themselves, characteristic of modernity, is put \\nin question. McLuhan\\'s formula, the medium is the message, which is the key formula of \\nthe era of simulation (the medium is the message - the sender is the receiver - the \\ncircularity of all poles - the end of panoptic and perspectival space - such is the alpha and \\nomega of our modernity), this very formula must be imagined at its limit where, after all \\nthe contents and messages have been volatilized in the medium, it is the medium itself \\nthat is volatilized as such. Fundamentally, it is still the message that lends credibility to \\nthe medium, that gives the medium its determined, distinct status as the intermediary of \\ncommunication. Without a message, the medium also falls into the indefinite state \\ncharacteristic of all our great systems of judgment and value. A single model, whose \\nefficacy is immediate, simultaneously generates the message, the medium, and the \"real.\" \\n\\nFinally, the medium is the message not only signifies the end of the message, but also the \\nend of the medium. There are no more media in the literal sense of the word (I\\'m \\nspeaking particularly of electronic mass media) - that is, of a mediating power between \\none reality and another, between one state of the real and another. Neither in content, nor \\nin form. Strictly, this is what implosion signifies. The absorption of one pole into another, \\nthe short-circuiting between poles of every differential system of meaning, the erasure of \\ndistinct terms and oppositions, including that of the medium and of the real - thus the \\nimpossibility of any mediation, of any dialectical intervention between the two or from \\none to the other. Circularity of all media effects. Hence the impossibility of meaning in \\nthe literal sense of a unilateral vector that goes from one pole to another. One must \\nenvisage this critical but original situation at its very limit: it is the only one left us. It is \\nuseless to dream of revolution through content, useless to dream of a revelation through \\nform, because the medium and the real are now in a single nebula whose truth is \\nindecipherable. \\n\\nThe fact of this implosion of contents, of the absorption of meaning, of the evanescence \\nof the medium itself, of the reabsorption of every dialectic of communication in a total \\ncircularity of the model, of the implosion of the social in the masses, may seem \\ncatastrophic and desperate. But this is only the case in light of the idealism that \\ndominates our whole view of information. We all live by a passionate idealism of \\nmeaning and of communication, by an idealism of communication through meaning, and, \\nfrom this perspective, it is truly the catastrophe of meaning that lies in wait for us. \\n\\nBut one must realize that \"catastrophe\" has this \"catastrophic\" meaning of end and \\nannihilation only in relation to a linear vision of accumulation, of productive finality, \\nimposed on us by the system. Etymologically, the term itself only signifies the curvature, \\n\\n\\n\\nthe winding down to the bottom of a cycle that leads to what one could call the \"horizon \\nof the event,\" to an impassable horizon of meaning: beyond that nothing takes place that \\nhas meaning for us - but it suffices to get out of this ultimatum of meaning in order for \\nthe catastrophe itself to no longer seem like a final and nihilistic day of reckoning, such \\nas it functions in our contemporary imaginary. \\n\\nBeyond meaning, there is the fascination that results from the neutralization and the \\nimplosion of meaning. Beyond the horizon of the social, there are the masses, which \\nresult from the neutralization and the implosion of the social. \\n\\nWhat is essential today is to evaluate this double challenge the challenge of the masses to \\nmeaning and their silence (which is not at all a passive resistance) - the challenge to \\nmeaning that comes from the media and its fascination. All the marginal, alternative \\nefforts to revive meaning are secondary in relation to that challenge. \\n\\nEvidently, there is a paradox in this inextricable conjunction of the masses and the media: \\ndo the media neutralize meaning and produce unformed [informe] or informed [informee] \\nmasses, or is it the masses who victoriously resist the media by directing or absorbing all \\nthe messages that the media produce without responding to them? Sometime ago, in \\n\"Requiem for the Media,\" I analyzed and condemned the media as the institution of an \\nirreversible model of communication without a response. But today? This absence of a \\nresponse can no longer be understood at all as a strategy of power, but as a \\ncounterstrategy of the masses themselves when they encounter power. What then? \\n\\nAre the mass media on the side of power in the manipulation of the masses, or are they \\non the side of the masses in the liquidation of meaning, in the violence perpetrated on \\nmeaning, and in fascination? Is it the media that induce fascination in the masses, or is it \\nthe masses who direct the media into the spectacle? Mogadishu-Stammheim: the media \\nmake themselves into the vehicle of the moral condemnation of terrorism and of the \\nexploitation of fear for political ends, but simultaneously, in the most complete \\nambiguity, they propagate the brutal charm of the terrorist act, they are themselves \\nterrorists, insofar as they themselves march to the tune of seduction (cf. Umberto Eco on \\nthis eternal moral dilemma: how can one not speak of terrorism, how can one find a good \\nuse of the media - there is none). The media carry meaning and countermeaning, they \\nmanipulate in all directions at once, nothing can control this process, they are the vehicle \\nfor the simulation internal to the system and the simulation that destroys the system, \\naccording to an absolutely Mobian and circular logic - and it is exactly like this. There is \\nno alternative to this, no logical resolution. Only a logical exacerbation and a catastrophic \\nresolution. \\n\\nWith one caution. We are face to face with this system in a double situation and insoluble \\ndouble bind - exactly like children faced with the demands of the adult world. Children \\nare simultaneously required to constitute themselves as autonomous subjects, \\nresponsible, free and conscious, and to constitute themselves as submissive, inert, \\nobedient, conforming objects. The child resists on all levels, and to a contradictory \\ndemand he responds with a double strategy. To the demand of being an object, he \\nopposes all the practices of disobedience, of revolt, of emancipation; in short, a total \\nclaim to subjecthood. To the demand of being a subject he opposes, just as obstinately \\n\\n\\n\\nand efficaciously, an object\\'s resistance, that is to say, exactly the opposite: childishness, \\nhyperconformism, total dependence, passivity, idiocy. Neither strategy has more \\nobjective value than the other. The subject-resistance is today unilaterally valorized and \\nviewed as positive - just as in the political sphere only the practices of freedom, \\nemancipation, expression, and the constitution of a political subject are seen as valuable \\nand subversive. But this is to ignore the equal, and without a doubt superior, impact of all \\nthe object practices, of the renunciation of the subject position and of meaning - precisely \\nthe practices of the masses - that we bury under the derisory terms of alienation and \\npassivity. The liberating practices respond to one of the aspects of the system, to the \\nconstant ultimatum we are given to constitute ourselves as pure objects, but they do not \\nrespond at all to the other demand, that of constituting ourselves as subjects, of liberating \\nourselves, expressing ourselves at whatever cost, of voting, producing, deciding, \\nspeaking, participating, playing the game - a form of blackmail and ultimatum just as \\nserious as the other, even more serious today. To a system whose argument is oppression \\nand repression, the strategic resistance is the liberating claim of subjecthood. But this \\nstrategy is more reflective of the earlier phase of the system, and even if we are still \\nconfronted with it, it is no longer the strategic terrain: the current argument of the system \\nis to maximize speech, the maximum production of meaning. Thus the strategic \\nresistance is that of the refusal of meaning and of the spoken word - or of the \\nhyperconformist simulation of the very mechanisms of the system, which is a form of \\nrefusal and of non-reception. It is the strategy of the masses: it is equivalent to returning \\nto the system its own logic by doubling it, to reflecting meaning, like a mirror, without \\nabsorbing it. This strategy (if one can still speak of strategy) prevails today, because it \\nwas ushered in by that phase of the system which prevails. \\n\\nTo choose the wrong strategy is a serious matter. All the movements that only play on \\nliberation, emancipation, on the resurrection of a subject of history, of the group, of the \\nword based on \"consciousness raising,\" indeed a \"raising of the unconscious\" of subjects \\nand of the masses, do not see that they are going in the direction of the system, whose \\nimperative today is precisely the overproduction and regeneration of meaning and of \\nspeech. \\n\\n* NOTE * \\n\\n1. Here we have not spoken of information except in the social register of \\ncommunication. But it would be enthralling to consider this hypothesis even within the \\nparameters of cybernetic information theory. There also, the fundamental thesis calls for \\nthis information to be synonymous with negentropy with the resistance to entropy, with \\nan excess of meaning and organization. But it would be useful to posit the opposite \\nhypothesis: INFORMATION = ENTROPY. For example: the information or knowledge \\nthat can be obtained about a system or an event is already a form of the neutralization and \\nentropy of this system (to be extended to science in general, and to the social sciences \\nand humanities in particular). Information in which an event is reflected or broadcast is \\nalready a degradedform of this event. Do not hesitate to analyze the media\\'s intervention \\nin May 1968 in these terms. The extension of the student action permitted the general \\nstrike, but the latter was precisely a black box that neutralized the original virulence of \\nthe movement. Amplification was itself a mortal trap and not a positive extension. One \\nshould be wary of the universalization of struggles through information. One should be \\n\\n\\n\\nwary of solidarity campaigns at every level, of this simultaneously electronic and worldly \\nsolidarity. Every strategy of the universalization of differences is an entropic strategy of \\nthe system. \\n\\n\\n\\nABSOLUTE ADVERTISING, GROUND-ZERO ADVERTISING \\n\\nToday what we are experiencing is the absorption of all virtual modes of expression into \\nthat of advertising. All original cultural forms, all determined languages are absorbed in \\nadvertising because it has no depth, it is instantaneous and instantaneously forgotten. \\nTriumph of superficial form, of the smallest common denominator of all signification, \\ndegree zero of meaning, triumph of entropy over all possible tropes. The lowest form of \\nenergy of the sign. This unarticulated, instantaneous form, without a past, without a \\nfuture, without the possiblity of metamorphosis, has power over all the others. All current \\nforms of activity tend toward advertising and most exhaust themselves therein. Not \\nnecessarily advertising itself, the kind that is produced as such - but the form of \\nadvertising, that of a simplified operational mode, vaguely seductive, vaguely consensual \\n(all the modalities are confused therein, but in an attenuated, agitated mode). More \\ngenerally, the form of advertising is one in which all particular contents are annulled at \\nthe very moment when they can be transcribed into each other, whereas what is inherent \\nto \"weighty\" enunciations, to articulated forms of meaning (or of style) is that they \\ncannot be translated into each other, any more than the rules of a game can be. \\n\\nThis long movement toward translatability and thus toward a complete combinatorial, \\nwhich is that of the superficial transparency of everything, of their absolute advertising \\n(of which professional advertising is, once again, only an episodic form), can be read in \\nthe vicissitudes of propaganda. \\n\\nThe whole scope of advertising and propaganda comes from the October Revolution and \\nthe market crash of 1929. Both languages of the masses, issuing from the mass \\nproduction of ideas, or commodities, their registers, separate at first, progressively \\nconverge. Propaganda becomes the marketing and merchandising of idea-forces, of \\npolitical men and parties with their \"trademark image.\" Propaganda approaches \\nadvertising as it would the vehicular model of the only great and veritable idea-force of \\nthis competing society, the commodity and the mark. This convergence defines a society- \\nours-in which there is no longer any difference between the economic and the political, \\nbecause the same language reigns in both, from one end to the other; a society therefore \\nwhere the political economy, literally speaking, is finally fully realized. That is to say \\ndissolved as a specific power (as an historical mode of social contradiction), resolute, \\nabsorbed in a language without contradictions, like a dream, because traversed by purely \\nsuperficial intensities. \\n\\nA subsequent stage is crossed once the very language of the social, after that of the \\npolitical, becomes confused with this fascinating solicitation of an agitated language, \\nonce the social turns itself into advertising, turns itself over to the popular vote by trying \\nto impose its trademark image. From the historical destiny that it was, the social itself fell \\nto the level of a \"collective enterprise\" securing its publicity on every level. See what \\nsurplus value of the social each advertisement tries to produce: werben werben (advertise \\nadvertise) - the solicitation of the social everywhere, present on walls, in the hot and \\nbloodless voices of female radio announcers, in the accents of the sound track and in the \\nmultiple tonalities of the image track that is played everywhere before our eyes. A \\nsociality everywhere present, an absolute sociality finally realized in absolute advertising \\n- that is to say, also totally dissolved, a vestige of sociality hallucinated on all the walls in \\n\\n\\nthe simplified form of a demand of the social that is immediately met by the echo of \\nadvertising. The social as a script, whose bewildered audience we are. \\n\\nThus the form of advertising has imposed itself and developed at the expense of all the \\nother languages as an increasingly neutral, equivalent rhetoric, without affects, as an \\n\"asyntactic nebula,\" Yves Stourdze would say, which envelops us from every side (and \\nwhich at the same time eliminates the hotly controversial problem of \"belief\" and \\nefficacy: it does not offer signifieds in which to invest, it offers a simplified equivalence \\nof all the formerly distinctive signs, and deters them with this very equivalence). This \\ndefines the limits of advertising\\'s current power and the conditions of its disappearance, \\nsince today advertising is no longer a stake, it has both \"entered into our customs\" and at \\nthe same time escaped the social and moral dramaturgy that it still represented twenty \\nyears ago. \\n\\nIt is not that people no longer believe in it or that they have accepted it as routine. It is \\nthat if its fascination once lay in its power to simplify all languages, today this power is \\nstolen from it by another type of language that is even more simplified and thus more \\nfunctional: the languages of computer science. The sequence model, the sound track, and \\nthe image track that advertising, along with the other big media, offers us - the model of \\nthe combinatory, equal distribution of all discourses that it proposes - this still rhetorical \\ncontinuum of sounds, signs, signals, slogans that it erects as a total environment is largely \\novertaken, precisely in its function of simulation, by the magnetic tape, by the electronic \\ncontinuum that is in the process of being silhouetted against the horizon of the end of this \\ncentury. Microprocessing, digitality, cybernetic languages go much further in the \\ndirection of the absolute simplification of processes than advertising did on its humble - \\nstill imaginary and spectacular-level. And it is because these systems go further that \\ntoday they polarize the fascination that formerly devolved on advertising. It is \\ninformation, in the sense of data processing, that will put an end to, that is already putting \\nan end to the reign of advertising. That is what inspires fear, and what is thrilling. The \\n\"thrill\" of advertising has been displaced onto computers and onto the miniaturization of \\neveryday life by computer science. \\n\\nThe anticipatory illustration of this transformation was Philip K. Dick\\'s papula - that \\ntransistorized advertising implant, a sort of broadcasting leech, an electronic parasite that \\nattaches itself to the body and that is very hard to get rid of. But the papula is still an \\nintermediary form: it is already a kind of incorporated prosthesis, but it still incessantly \\nrepeats advertising messages. A hybrid, then, but a prefiguration of the psychotropic and \\ndataprocessing networks of the automatic piloting of individuals, next to which the \\n\"conditioning\" by advertising looks like a delightful change in fortune. \\n\\nCurrently, the most interesting aspect of advertising is its disappearance, its dilution as a \\nspecific form, or even as a medium. Advertising is no longer (was it ever?) a means of \\ncommunication or of information. Or else it is overtaken by the madness specific to \\noverdeveloped systems, that of voting for itself at each moment, and thus of parodying \\nitself. If at a given moment, the commodity was its own publicity (there was no other) \\ntoday publicity has become its own commodity. It is confused with itself (and the \\neroticism with which it ridiculously cloaks itself is nothing but the autoerotic index of a \\nsystem that does nothing but designate itself - whence the absurdity of seeing in it an \\n\\n\\n\\nalienation\" of the female body). \\n\\n\\nAs a medium become its own message (which makes it so that now there is a demand for \\nadvertising in and of itself, and that thus the question of \"believing\" in it or not is no \\nlonger even posed), advertising is completely in unison with the social, whose historical \\nnecessity has found itself absorbed by the pure and simple demand for the social: a \\ndemand that the social function like a business, a group of services, a mode of living or of \\nsurvival (the social must be saved just as nature must be preserved: the social is our \\nniche) - whereas formerly it was a sort of revolution in its very project. This is certainly \\nlost: the social has lost precisely this power of illusion, it has fallen into the register of \\nsupply and demand, just as work has passed from being a force antagonistic to capital to \\nthe simple status of employment, that is to say of goods (eventually rare) and services \\njust like the others. One can thus create advertising for work, the joy of finding work, just \\nas one will be able to create advertising for the social. And, today, true advertising lies \\ntherein: in the design of the social, in the exaltation of the social in all its forms, in the \\nfierce, obstinate reminder of a social, the need for which makes itself rudely felt. \\n\\nFolkloric dances in the metro, innumerable campaigns for security, the slogan \"tomorrow \\nI work\" accompanied by a smile formerly reserved for leisure time, and the advertising \\nsequence for the election to the Prud-hommes (an industrial tribunal): \"I don\\'t let anyone \\nchoose for me\" - an Ubuesque slogan, one that rang so spectacularly falsely, with a \\nmocking liberty, that of proving the social while denying it. It is not by chance that \\nadvertising, after having, for a long time, carried an implicit ultimatum of an economic \\nkind, fundamentally saying and repeating incessantly, \"I buy, I consume, I take \\npleasure,\" today repeats in other forms, \"I vote, I participate, I am present, I am \\nconcerned\" - mirror of a paradoxical mockery, mirror of the indifference of all public \\nsignification. \\n\\nThe opposite panic: one knows that the social can be dissolved in a panic reaction, an \\nuncontrollable chain reaction. But it can also be dissolved in the opposite reaction, a \\nchain reaction of inertia, each microuniverse saturated, autoregulated, computerized, \\nisolated in automatic pilot. Advertising is the prefiguration of this: the first manifestation \\nof an uninterrupted thread of signs, like ticker tape - each isolated in its inertia. \\nDisaffected, but saturated. Desensitized, but ready to crack. It is in such a universe that \\nwhat Virilio calls the aesthetic of disappearance gathers strength, that the following being \\nto appear: fractal objects, fractal forms, fault zones that follow saturation, and thus a \\nprocess of massive rejection, of the abreaction or stupor of a society purely transparent to \\nitself. Like the signs in advertising, one is geared down, one becomes transparent or \\nuncountable, one becomes diaphanous or rhizomic to escape the point of inertia - one is \\nplaced in orbit, one is plugged in, one is satellized, one is archived - paths cross: there is \\nthe sound track, the image track, just as in life there is the work track, the leisure track, \\nthe transport track, etc., all enveloped in the advertising track. Everywhere there are three \\nor four paths, and you are at the crossroads. Superficial saturation and fascination. \\n\\nBecause fascination remains. One need only look at Las Vegas, the absolute advertising \\ncity (of the 1950s, of the crazy years of advertising, which has retained the charm of that \\nera, today retro in some sense, because advertising is secretly condemned by the \\nprogrammatic logic that will give rise to very different cities). When one sees Las Vegas \\n\\n\\n\\nrise whole from the desert in the radiance of advertising at dusk, and return to the desert \\nwhen dawn breaks, one sees that advertising is not what brightens or decorates the walls, \\nit is what effaces the walls, effaces the streets, the facades, and all the architecture, \\neffaces any support and any depth, and that it is this liquidation, this reabsorption of \\neverything into the surface (whatever signs circulate there) that plunges us into this \\nstupefied, hyperreal euphoria that we would not exchange for anything else, and that is \\nthe empty and inescapable form of seduction. \\n\\n\\nLanguage allows itself to be dragged along by its double, and joins the best to the worst \\nfor a phantom of rationality whose formula is \"Everyone must believe in it.\" Such is the \\nmessage of what unites us. \\n\\n- J. L. Bouttes, Le destructeur d\\'intensites (The Destroyer of Intensities) \\n\\n\\nAdvertising, therefore, like information: destroyer of intensities, accelerator of inertia. \\n\\nSee how all the artifices of meaning and of nonmeaning are repeated in it with lassitude, \\nlike all the procedures, all the mechanisms of the language of communication (the \\nfunction of contact: you understand me? Are you looking at me? It will speak! - the \\nreferential function, the poetic function even, the allusion, the irony, the game of words, \\nthe unconscious), how all of that is staged exactly like sex in pornography, that is to say \\nwithout any faith, with the same tired obscenity. That is why, now, it is useless to analyze \\nadvertising as language, because something else is happening there: a doubling of \\nlanguage (and also of images), to which neither linguistics nor semiology correspond, \\nbecause they function on the veritable operation of meaning, without the slightest \\nsuspicion of this caricatural exorbitance of all the functions of language, this opening \\nonto an immense field of the mockery of signs, \"consumed\" as one says in their mockery, \\nfor their mockery and the collective spectacle of their game without stakes - just as porno \\nis a hypertrophied fiction of sex consumed in its mockery, for its mockery, a collective \\nspectacle of the inanity of sex in its baroque assumption (it was the baroque that invented \\nthis triumphal mockery of stucco, fixing the disappearance of the religious in the orgasm \\nof statues). \\n\\nWhere is the golden age of the advertising project? The exaltation of an object by an \\nimage, the exaltation of buying and of consumption through the sumptuary spending of \\nadvertising? Whatever the subjugation of publicity to the management of capital (but this \\naspect of the question - that of the social and economic impact of publicity - always \\nremains unresolved and fundamentally insoluble), it always had more than a subjugated \\nfunction, it was a mirror held out to the universe of political economy and of the \\ncommodity, it was for a moment their glorious imaginary, that of a torn-up world, but an \\nexpanding one. But the universe of the commodity is no longer this one: it is a world both \\nsaturated and in involution. In one blow, it lost both its triumphal imaginary, and, from \\nthe mirror stage, it passed in some sense to the stage of mourning. \\n\\nThere is no longer a staging of the commodity: there is only its obscene and empty form. \\nAnd advertising is the illustration of this saturated and empty form. \\n\\n\\nThat is why advertising no longer has a territory. Its recoverable forms no longer have \\n\\n\\n\\nany meaning. The Forum des Halles, for example, is a gigantic advertising unit - an \\noperation of publicitude. It is not the advertising of a particular person, of any firm, the \\nForum also does not have the status of a veritable mall or architectural whole, any more \\nthan Beaubourg is, in the end, a cultural center: these strange objects, these supergadgets \\nsimply demonstrate that our social monumentality has become advertising. And it is \\nsomething like the Forum that best illustrates what advertising has become, what the \\npublic domain has become. \\n\\nThe commodity is buried, like information is in archives, like archives are in bunkers, \\nlike missiles are in atomic silos. \\n\\nGone the happy and displayed commodity, now that it flees the sun, and suddenly it is \\nlike a man who has lost his shadow. Thus the Forum des Halles closely resembles a \\nfuneral home - the funereal luxury of a commodity buried, transparent, in a black sun. \\nSarcophagus of the commodity. \\n\\nEverything there is sepulchral - white, black, salmon marble. A bunker-case-in deep, \\nsnobbish, dull black-mineral underground space. Total absence of fluids; there is no \\nlonger even a liquid gadget like the veil of water at Parly 2*1 which at least fooled the \\neye - here not even an amusing subterfuge, only pretentious mourning is staged. (The \\nonly amusing idea in the whole thing is precisely the human and his shadow who walk in \\ntrompe l\\'oeil on the vertical dais of concrete: a gigantic, beautiful gray, open-air canvas, \\nserving as a frame to the trompe l\\'oeil, this wall lives without having wished to, in \\ncontrast to the family vault of haute couture and pret-a-porter that constitutes the Forum. \\nThis shadow is beautiful because it is an allusion in contrast to the inferior world that has \\nlost its shadow.) \\n\\nAll that one could hope for, once this sacred space was opened to the public, and for fear \\nthat pollution, as in the Lascaux caves, cause it to deteriorate irremediably (think of the \\nwaves of people from the RER) *2 was that it be immediately closed off to circulation \\nand covered with a definitive shroud in order to keep this testimony to a civilization that \\nhas arrived, after having passed the stage of the apogee, at the stage of the hypogee, of \\nthe commodity, intact. There is a fresco here that traces the long route traversed, starting \\nwith the man of Tautavel passing through Marx and Einstein to arrive at Dorothee Bis . . \\n.Why not save this fresco from decomposition? Later the speleologists will rediscover it, \\nat the same time that they discover a culture that chose to bury itself in order to \\ndefinitively escape its own shadow, to bury its seductions and its artifices as if it were \\nalready consecrating them to another world. \\n\\n* NOTES * \\n\\n1.

This is not always the case, however: \\nwhen the double materializes, when it becomes visible, it signifies imminent death. \\n\\nIn other words, the imaginary power and wealth of the double - the one in which the \\nstrangeness and at the same time the intimacy of the subject to itself are played out \\n(heimlich/ unheimlich) - rests on its immateriality, on the fact that it is and remains a \\nphantasm. Everyone can dream, and must have dreamed his whole life, of a perfect \\nduplication or multiplication of his being, but such copies only have the power of dreams, \\nand are destroyed when one attempts to force the dream into the real. The same is true of \\nthe (primal) scene of seduction: it only functions when it is phantasmed, reremembered, \\nnever real. It belonged to our era to wish to exorcise this phantasm like the others, that is \\nto say to want to realize, materialize it in flesh and bone and, in a completely contrary \\nway, to change the game of the double from a subtle exchange of death with the Other \\ninto the eternity of the Same. \\n\\nClones. Cloning. Human cuttings ad infinitum, each individual cell of an organism \\ncapable of again becoming the matrix of an identical individual. In the United States, a \\nchild was bom a few months ago like a geranium: from cuttings. The first clone child (the \\nlineage of an individual via vegetal multiplication). The first bom from a single cell of a \\nsingle individual, his \"father,\" the sole progenitor, of which he would be the exact \\nreplica, the perfect twin, the double. *1 \\n\\nDream of an eternal twining substituted for sexual procreation that is linked to death. \\nCellular dream of scissiparity, the purest form of parentage, because it finally allows one \\nto do without the other, to go from the same to the same (one still has to use the uterus of \\na woman, and a pitted ovum, but this support is ephemeral, and in any case anonymous: a \\nfemale prosthesis could replace it). Monocellular Utopia which, by way of genetics, \\nallows complex beings to achieve the destiny of protozoas. \\n\\nWhat, if not a death drive, would push sexed beings to regress to a form of reproduction \\nprior to sexuation (besides, isn\\'t it this form of scissiparity, this reproduction and \\nproliferation through pure contiguity that is for us, in the depths of our imaginary, death \\nand the death drive - what denies sexuality and wants to annihilate it, sexuality being the \\ncarrier of life, that is to say of a critical and mortal form of reproduction?) and that, at the \\nsame time, would push them metaphysically to deny all alterity, all alteration of the Same \\nin order to aim solely for the perpetuation of an identity, a transparency of the genetic \\ninscription no longer even subject to the vicissitudes of procreation? \\n\\nLet\\'s leave the death drive aside. Is it a question of the phantasm of auto-genesis? No, \\nbecause such a fantasy still passes through the figures of the mother and the father, sexed \\nparental figures that the subject can dream of effacing by substituting himself for them, \\n\\n\\nbut without denying the symbolic structure of procreation at all: becoming one\\'s own \\nchild is still being someone\\'s child. Whereas cloning radically abolishe\\'s the Mother, but \\nalso the Father, the intertwining of their genes, the imbrication of their differences, but \\nabove all the joint act that is procreation. The cloner does not beget himself: he sprouts \\nfrom each of his segments. One can speculate on the wealth of each of these vegetal \\nbranchings that in effect resolve all oedipal sexuality in the service of \"nonhuman\" sex, \\nof sex through immediate contiguity and reduction - it is still the case that it is no longer \\na question of the fantasy of auto-genesis. The Father and the Mother have disappeared, \\nnot in the service of an aleatory liberty of the subject, but in the service of a matrix called \\ncode. No more mother, no more father: a matrix. And it is the matrix, that of the genetic \\ncode, that now infinitely \"gives birth\" based on a functional mode purged of all aleatory \\nsexuality. \\n\\nThe subject is also gone, since identical duplication puts an end to his division. The \\nmirror stage is abolished in cloning, or rather it is parodied therein in a monstruous \\nfashion. Cloning also retains nothing, and for the same reason, of the immemorial and \\nnarcissistic dream of the subject\\'s projection into his ideal alter ego, since this projection \\nstill passes through an image: the one in the mirror, in which the subject is alienated in \\norder to find himself again, or the one, seductive and mortal, in which the subject sees \\nhimself in order to die there. None of this occurs in cloning. No more medium, no more \\nimage - any more than an industrial object is the mirror of the identical one that succeeds \\nit in the series. One is never the ideal or mortal mirage of the other, they can only be \\nadded to each other, and if they can only be added, it means that they are not sexually \\nengendered and know nothing of death. \\n\\nIt is no longer even a question of being twins, since Gemini or Twins possess a specific \\nproperty, a particular and sacred fascination of the Two, of what is two together, and \\nnever was one. Whereas cloning enshrines the reiteration of the same: I + I + I + I, etc. \\n\\nNeither child, nor twin, nor narcissistic reflection, the clone is the materialization of the \\ndouble by genetic means, that is to say the abolition of all alterity and of any imaginary. \\nWhich is combined with the economy of sexuality. Delirious apotheosis of a productive \\ntechnology. \\n\\nA segment has no need of imaginary mediation in order to reproduce itself, any more \\nthan the earthworm needs earth: each segment of the worm is directly reproduced as a \\nwhole worm, just as each cell of the American CEO can produce a new CEO. Just as \\neach fragment of a hologram can again become the matrix of the complete hologram: the \\ninformation remains whole, with perhaps somewhat less definition, in each of the \\ndispersed fragments of the hologram. \\n\\nThis is how one puts an end to totality. If all information can be found in each of its parts, \\nthe whole loses its meaning. It is also the end of the body, of this singularity called body, \\nwhose secret is precisely that it cannot be segmented into additional cells, that it is an \\nindivisible configuration, to which its sexuation is witness (paradox: cloning will \\nfabricate sexed beings in perpetuity, since they are similar to their model, whereas \\nthereby sex becomes useless - but precisely sex is not a function, it is what makes a body \\na body, it is what exceeds all the parts, all the diverse functions of this body). Sex (or \\n\\n\\n\\ndeath: in this sense it is the same thing) is what exceeds all information that can be \\ncollected on a body. Well, where is all this information collected? In the genetic formula. \\nThis is why it must necessarily want to forge a path of autonomous reproduction, \\nindependent of sexuality and of death. \\n\\nAlready, biophysioanatomical science, by dissecting the body into organs and functions, \\nbegins the process of the analytic decomposition of the body, and micromolecular \\ngenetics is nothing but the logical consequence, though at a much higher level of \\nabstraction and simulation - at the nuclear level of the command cell, at the direct level of \\nthe genetic code, around which this whole phantasmagoria is organized. \\n\\nFrom a functional and mechanistic point of view, each organ is still only a partial and \\ndifferentiated prosthesis: already simulation, but \"traditional.\" From the point of view of \\ncybernetics and computer science, it is the smallest undifferentiated element, each cell of \\na body becomes an \"embryonic\" prosthesis of this body. It is the genetic formula \\ninscribed in each cell that becomes the veritable modern prosthesis of all bodies. If the \\nprosthesis is commonly an artifact that supplements a failing organ, or the instrumental \\nextension of a body, then the DN A molecule, which contains all information relative to a \\nbody, is the prosthesis par excellence, the one that will allow for the indefinite extension \\nof this body by the body itself - this body itself being nothing but the indefinite series of \\nits prostheses. \\n\\nA cybernetic prosthesis infinitely more subtle and still more artificial than any \\nmechanical prosthesis. Because the genetic code is not \"natural\": just as every abstract \\nand autonomized part of a whole becomes an artificial prosthesis that alters this whole by \\nsubstituting itself for it (pro-thesis: this is the etymological meaning), one can say that the \\ngenetic code, where the whole of a being is supposedly condensed because all the \\n\"information\" of this being would be imprisoned there (there lies the incredible violence \\nof genetic simulation) is an artifact, an operational prosthesis, an abstract matrix, from \\nwhich will be able to emerge, no longer even through reproduction, but through pure and \\nsimple renewal, identical beings assigned to the same controls. \\n\\n\\nMy genetic patrimony was fixed once and for all when a certain spermatozoa \\nencountered a certain ovum. This heritage contains the recipe for all the biochemical \\nprocesses that realized me and ensure my functioning. A copy of this recipe is inscribed \\nin each of the dozens of mi llions of cells that constitute me today. Each of these cells \\nknows how to manufacture me; before being a cell of my liver or of my blood, it is a cell \\nof me. It is thus theoretically possible to manufacture an individual identical to me \\nstarting with one of these cells. (Professor A. Jacquard) \\n\\n\\nCloning is thus the last stage of the history and modeling of the body, the one at which, \\nreduced to its abstract and genetic formula, the individual is destined to serial \\npropagation. It is necessary to revisit what Walter Benjamin said of the work of art in the \\nage of its mechanical reproducibility. What is lost in the work that is serially reproduced, \\nis its aura, its singular quality of the here and now, its aesthetic form (it had already lost \\nits ritual form, in its aesthetic quality), and, according to Benjamin, it takes on, in its \\n\\n\\n\\nineluctable destiny of reproduction, a political form. What is lost is the original, which \\nonly a history itself nostalgic and retrospective can reconstitute as \"authentic.\" The most \\nadvanced, the most modern form of this development, which Benjamin described in \\ncinema, photography, and contemporary mass media, is one in which the original no \\nlonger even exists, since things are conceived from the beginning as a function of their \\nunlimited reproduction. \\n\\nThis is what happens to us with cloning, no longer only at the level of messages, but at \\nthe level of individuals. In fact this is what happens to the body when it ceases to be \\nconceived as anything but a message, as a stockpile of information and of messages, as \\nfodder for data processing. Thus nothing is opposed to the body being serially reproduced \\nin the same way Benjamin describes the reproduction of industrial objects and the images \\nof the mass media. There is a precession of reproduction over production, a precession of \\nthe genetic model over all possible bodies. It is the irruption of technology that controls \\nthis reversal, of a technology that Benjamin was already describing, in its total \\nconsequences, as a total medium, but one still of the industrial age - a gigantic prosthesis \\nthat controlled the generation of objects and identical images, in which nothing could be \\ndifferentiated any longer from anything else - but still without imagining the current \\nsophistication of this technology, which renders the generation of identical beings \\npossible, though there is no possibility of a return to an original being. The prostheses of \\nthe industrial age are still external, exotechnical, those that we know have been \\nsubdivided and internalized: esotechnical. We are in the age of soft technologies - genetic \\nand mental software. \\n\\nAs long as the prostheses of the old industrial golden age were mechanical, they still \\nreturned to the body in order to modify its image - conversely, they themselves were \\nmetabolized in the imaginary and this technological metabolism was also part of the \\nimage of the body. But when one reaches a point of no return (deadend) in simulation, \\nthat is to say when the prosthesis goes deeper, is interiorized in, infiltrates the anonymous \\nand micro-molecular heart of the body, as soon as it is imposed on the body itself as the \\n\"original\" model, burning all the previous symbolic circuits, the only possible body the \\nimmutable repetition of the prosthesis, then it is the end of the body, of its history, and of \\nits vicissitudes. The individual is no longer anything but a cancerous metastasis of its \\nbase formula. All the individuals produced through cloning individual X, are they \\nanything other than a cancerous metastasis - the proliferation of the same cell such as \\noccurs with cancer? There is a narrow relation between the key concept of the genetic \\ncode and the pathology of cancer: the code designates the smallest simple element, the \\nminimal formula to which an entire individual can be reduced, and in such a way that he \\ncan only reproduce himself identically to himself. Cancer designates a proliferation ad \\ninfinitum of a base cell without taking into consideration the organic laws of the whole. It \\nis the same thing with cloning: nothing opposes itself any longer to the renewal of the \\nSame, to the unchecked proliferation of a single matrix. Formerly, sexed reproduction \\nstill stood in opposition to this, today one can finally isolate the genetic matrix of \\nidentity, and one will be able to eliminate all the differential vicissitudes that once \\nconstituted the aleatory charm of individuals. \\n\\nIf all cells are conceived primarily as a receptacle of the same genetic formula - not only \\nall the identical individuals, but all the cells of the same individual - what are they but the \\n\\n\\n\\ncancerous extension of this base formula? The metastasis that began with industrial \\nobjects ends with cellular organization. It is useless to ask oneself if cancer is an illness \\nof the capitalist age. It is in effect the illness that controls all contemporary pathology, \\nbecause it is the very form of the virulence of the code: an exacerbated redundancy of the \\nsame signals, an exacerbated redundancy of the same cells. \\n\\nThe stage of the body changes in the course of an irreversible technological \\n\"progression\": from tanning in the sun, which already corresponds to an artificial use of \\nthe natural medium, that is to say to making it a prosthesis of the body (itself becoming a \\nsimulated body, but where lies the truth of the body?) - to domestic tanning with an \\niodine lamp (yet another good old mechanical technique) - to tanning with pills and \\nhormones (chemical and ingested prosthesis) - and finally to tanning by intervening in \\nthe genetic formula (an incomparably more advanced stage, but a prosthesis nonetheless, \\nthat is, it is simply definitively integrated, it no longer even passes through either the \\nsurface or the orifices of the body), one passes by different bodies. It is the schema of the \\nwhole that is metamorphosed. The traditional prosthesis, which serves to repair a failing \\norgan, changes nothing in the general model of the body. Organ transplants are still of \\nthis order. But what should be said of mental modeling via psychotropic agents and \\ndrugs? It is the stage of the body that is changed by them. The psychotropic body is a \\nbody modeled \"from the inside,\" no longer passing through the per-spectival space of \\nrepresentation, of the mirror, and of discourse. A silent, mental, already molecular (and \\nno longer specular) body, a body metabolized directly, without the mediation of the act or \\nthe gaze, an immanent body, without alterity without a mise en scene, without \\ntranscendence, a body consecrated to the implosive metabolism of cerebral, endocrinal \\nflows, a sensory, but not sensible, body because it is connected only to its internal \\nterminals, and not to objects of perception (the reason why one can enclose it in a \\n\"white,\" blank sensoriality - disconnecting it from its own sensorial extremities, without \\ntouching the world that surrounds it, suffices), a body already homogeneous, at this stage \\nof plastic tactility, of mental malleability, of psychotropism at every level, already close \\nto nuclear and genetic manipulation, that is to say to the absolute loss of the image, \\nbodies that cannot be represented, either to others or to themselves, bodies enucleated of \\ntheir being and of their meaning by being transfigured into a genetic formula or through \\nbiochemical instability: point of no return, apotheosis of a technology that has itself \\nbecome interstitial and molecular. \\n\\n* NOTES * \\n\\nOne must take into account that cancerous proliferation is also a silent disobedience of \\nthe injunctions of the genetic code. Cancer, if it fits with the logic of a nuclear/computer \\nscience vision of human beings, is also its monstrous excrescence and negation, because \\nit leads to total disinformation and to disaggregation. \"Revolutionary\" pathology of \\norganic abandonment, Richard Pinhas would say, in Fictions (\"Notes synoptiques a \\npropos d\\'un mal mysterieux\" [Synoptic notes on a mysterious illness]). Entropic delirium \\nof organisms, resisting the negentropy of informational systems. (It is the same \\nconjunction as that of the masses vis-a-vis structured social formations: the masses are \\nalso cancerous metastases outside any social organicity.) \\n\\nThe same ambiguity is operative in cloning: it is at once the triumph of a controlling \\n\\n\\n\\nhypothesis, that of the code and of genetic information, and an eccentric distortion that \\ndestroys its coherence. Besides, it is probable (but this is left to a future story) that even \\nthe \"clonic twin\" will never be identical to its progenitor, will never be the same, if only \\nbecause it will have had another before it. It will never be \"just like what the genetic code \\nin itself would have changed it to.\" Millions of interferences will make of it, despite \\neverything, a different being, who will have the very same blue eyes of its father, which \\nis not new. And the cloning experiment will at least have the advantage of demonstrating \\nthe radical impossibility of mastering a process simply by mastering information and the \\ncode. Note: A version of this essay with a different ending appeared under the title \"The \\nHell of the Same\" in Baudrillard\\'s The Transparency of Evil: Essays on Extreme \\nPhenomena, trans. James Benedict (London and New York: Verso, 1993).-TRANS. \\n\\nI. Cf. D. Rorvik, A son image: La copie d\\'un homme (In his image: The copy of a man) \\n(Paris: Grasset, 1978). \\n\\n\\n\\nHOLOGRAMS \\n\\n\\nIt is the fantasy of seizing reality live that continues - ever since Narcissus bent over his \\nspring. Surprising the real in order to immobilize it, suspending the real in the expiration \\nof its double. You bend over the hologram like God over his creature: only God has this \\npower of passing through walls, through people, and finding Himself immaterially in the \\nbeyond. We dream of passing through ourselves and of finding ourselves in the beyond: \\nthe day when your holographic double will be there in space, eventually moving and \\ntalking, you will have realized this miracle. Of course, it will no longer be a dream, so its \\ncharm will be lost. \\n\\nThe TV studio transforms you into holographic characters: one has the impression of \\nbeing materialized in space by the light of projectors, like translucid characters who pass \\nthrough the masses (that of millions of TV viewers) exactly as your real hand passes \\nthrough the unreal hologram without encountering any resistance - but not without \\nconsequences: having passed through the hologram has rendered your hand unreal as \\nwell. \\n\\nThe hallucination is total and truly fascinating once the hologram is projected in front of \\nthe plaque, so that nothing separates you from it (or else the effect remains photo- or \\ncinematographic). This is also characteristic of trompe l\\'oeil, in contrast to painting: \\ninstead of a field as a vanishing point for the eye, you are in a reversed depth, which \\ntransforms you into a vanishing point. . . The relief must leap out at you just as a tram \\ncar and a chess game would. This said, which type of objects or forms will be \\n\"hologenic\" remains to be discovered since the hologram is no more destined to produce \\nthree-dimensional cinema than cinema was destined to reproduce theater, or photography \\nwas to take up the contents of painting. \\n\\nIn the hologram, it is the imaginary aura of the double that is mercilessly tracked, just as \\nit is in the history of clones. Similitude is a dream and must remain one, in order for a \\nmodicum of illusion and a stage of the imaginary to exist. One must never pass over to \\nthe side of the real, the side of the exact resemblance of the world to itself, of the subject \\nto itself. Because then the image disappears. One must never pass over to the side of the \\ndouble, because then the dual relation disappears, and with it all seduction. Well, with the \\nhologram, as with the clone, it is the opposite temptation, and the opposite fascination, of \\nthe end of illusion, the stage, the secret through the materialized projection of all \\navailable information on the subject, through materialized transparency. \\n\\nAfter the fantasy of seeing oneself (the mirror, the photograph) comes that of being able \\nto circle around oneself, finally and especially of traversing oneself, of passing through \\none\\'s own spectral body - and any holographed object is initially the luminous ectoplasm \\nof your own body. But this is in some sense the end of the aesthetic and the triumph of \\nthe medium, exactly as in stereo-phonia, which, at its most sophisticated limits, neatly \\nputs an end to the charm and the intelligence of music. \\n\\nThe hologram simply does not have the intelligence of trompe l\\'oeil, which is one of \\nseduction, of always proceeding, according to the rules of appearances, through allusion \\n\\n\\nto and ellipsis of presence. It veers, on the contrary, into fascination, which is that of \\npassing to the side of the double. If, according to Mach, the universe is that of which \\nthere is no double, no equivalent in the mirror, then with the hologram we are already \\nvirtually in another universe: which is nothing but the mirrored equivalent of this one. \\n\\nBut which universe is this one? \\n\\nThe hologram, the one of which we have always already dreamed (but these are only \\npoor bricolages of it) gives us the feeling, the vertigo of passing to the other side of our \\nown body, to the side of the double, luminous clone, or dead twin that is never born in \\nour place, and watches over us by anticipation. \\n\\nThe hologram, perfect image and end of the imaginary. Or rather, it is no longer an image \\nat all - the real medium is the laser, concentrated light, quintessentialized, which is no \\nlonger a visible or reflexive light, but an abstract light of simulation. Laser/scalpel. A \\nluminous surgery whose function here is that of the double: one operates on you to \\nremove the double as one would operate to remove a tumor. The double that hid in the \\ndepths of you (of your body, of your unconscious?) and whose secret form fed precisely \\nyour imaginary, on the condition of remaining secret, is extracted by laser, is synthesized \\nand materialized before you, just as it is possible for you to pass through and beyond it. A \\nhistorical moment: the hologram is now part of this \"subliminal comfort\" that is our \\ndestiny, of this happiness now consecrated to the mental simulacrum and to the \\nenvironmental fable of special effects. (The social, the social phantasmagoria, is now \\nnothing but a special effect, obtained by the design of participating networks converging \\nin emptiness under the spectral image of collective happiness.) \\n\\nThree-dimensionality of the simulacrum - why would the simulacrum with three \\ndimensions be closer to the real than the one with two dimensions? It claims to be, but \\nparadoxically, it has the opposite effect: to render us sensitive to the fourth dimension as \\na hidden truth, a secret dimension of everything, which suddenly takes on all the force of \\nevidence. The closer one gets to the perfection of the simulacrum (and this is true of \\nobjects, but also of figures of art or of models of social or psychological relations), the \\nmore evident it becomes (or rather to the evil spirit of incredulity that inhabits us, more \\nevil still than the evil spirit of simulation) how everything escapes representation, escapes \\nits own double and its resemblance. In short, there is no real: the third dimension is only \\nthe imaginary of a two-dimensional world, the fourth that of a three-dimensional universe \\n. . . Escalation in the production of a real that is more and more real through the addition \\nof successive dimensions. But, on the other hand, exaltation of the opposite movement: \\nonly what plays with one less dimension is true, is truly seductive. \\n\\nIn any case, there is no escape from this race to the real and to realistic hallucination \\nsince, when an object is exactly l ik e another, it is not exactly like it, it is a bit more exact. \\nThere is never similitude, any more than there is exactitude. What is exact is already too \\nexact, what is exact is only what approaches the truth without trying. It is somewhat of \\nthe same paradoxical order as the formula that says that as soon as two billiard balls roll \\ntoward each other, the first touches the other before the second, or, rather, one touches \\nthe other before being touched. Which indicates that there is not even the possibility of \\nsimultaneity in the order of time, and in the same way no similitude possible in the order \\nof figures. Nothing resembles itself, and holographic reproduction, like all fantasies of \\n\\n\\n\\nthe exact synthesis or resurrection of the real (this also goes for scientific \\nexperimentation), is already no longer real, is already hyperreal. It thus never has \\nreproductive (truth) value, but always already simulation value. Not an exact, but a \\ntransgressive truth, that is to say already on the other side of the truth. What happens on \\nthe other side of the truth, not in what would be false, but in what is more true than the \\ntrue, more real than the real? Bizarre effects certainly, and sacrileges, much more \\ndestructive of the order of truth than its pure negation. Singular and murderous power of \\nthe potentialization of the truth, of the potentialization of the real. This is perhaps why \\ntwins were deified, and sacrificed, in a more savage culture: hypersimilitude was \\nequivalent to the murder of the original, and thus to a pure non-meaning. Any \\nclassification or signification, any modality of meaning can thus be destroyed simply by \\nlogically being elevated to the nth power - pushed to its limit, it is as if all truth \\nswallowed its own criteria of truth as one \"swallows one\\'s birth certificate\" and lost all its \\nmeaning. Thus the weight of the world, or the universe, can eventually be calculated in \\nexact terms, but initially it appears absurd, because it no longer has a reference, or a \\nmirror in which it can come to be reflected - this totalization, which is practically \\nequivalent to that of all the dimensions of the real in its hyperreal double, or to that of all \\nthe information on an individual in his genetic double (clone), renders it immediately \\npataphysical. The universe itself, taken globally, is what cannot be represented, what \\ndoes not have a possible complement in the mirror, what has no equivalence in meaning \\n(it is as absurd to give it a meaning, a weight of meaning, as to give it weight at all). \\nMeaning, truth, the real cannot appear except locally, in a restricted horizon, they are \\npartial objects, partial effects of the mirror and of equivalence. All doubling, all \\ngeneralization, all passage to the limit, all holographic extension (the fancy of \\nexhaustively taking account of this universe) makes them surface in their mockery. \\n\\nViewed at this angle, even the exact sciences come dangerously close to pataphysics. \\nBecause they depend in some way on the hologram and on the objectivist whim of the \\ndeconstruction and exact reconstruction of the world (in its smallest terms) founded on a \\ntenacious and naive faith in a pact of the similitude of things to themselves. The real, the \\nreal object is supposed to be equal to itself, it is supposed to resemble itself like a face in \\na mirror - and this virtual similitude is in effect the only definition of the real - and any \\nattempt, including the holographic one, that rests on it, will inevitably miss its object, \\nbecause it does not take its shadow into account (precisely the reason why it does not \\nresemble itself) - this hidden face where the object crumbles, its secret. The holographic \\nattempt literally jumps over its shadow, and plunges into transparency, to lose itself there. \\n\\n\\n\\nCRASH \\n\\n\\nFrom a classical (even cybernetic) perspective, technology is an extension of the body. It \\nis the functional sophistication of a human organism that permits it to be equal to nature \\nand to invest triumphally in nature. From Marx to McLuhan, the same functionalist \\nvision of machines and language: they are relays, extensions, media mediators of nature \\nideally destined to become the organic body of man. In this \"rational\" perspective the \\nbody itself is nothing but a medium. \\n\\nOn the other hand, in the apocalyptic and baroque version of Crash* 1 technology is the \\nmortal deconstruction of the body - no longer a functional medium, but the extension of \\ndeath - the dismemberment and cutting to pieces, not in the pejorative illusion of a lost \\nunity of the subject (which is still the horizon of psychoanalysis), but in the explosive \\nvision of a body delivered to \"symbolic wounds,\" of a body confused with technology in \\nits violating and violent dimension, in the savage and continual surgery that violence \\nexercises: incisions, excisions, scarifications, the chasms of the body, of which the sexual \\nwounds and pleasures of the body are only a particular case (and mechanical servitude in \\nwork, its pacified caricature) - a body without organs or pleasure of the organs, entirely \\nsubjected to the mark, to cutting, to the technical scar - under the shining sign of a \\nsexuality without a referential and without limits. \\n\\n\\nHer mutilation and death became a coronation of her image at the hands of a colliding \\ntechnology, a celebration of her individual limbs and facial planes, gestures and s ki n \\ntones. Each of the spectators at the accident site would carry away an image of the \\nviolent transformation of this woman, of the complex of wounds that fused together her \\nown sexuality and the hard technology of the automobile. Each of them would join his \\nown imagination, the tender membranes of his mucous surfaces, his grooves of erectile \\ntissue, to the wounds of this minor actresss through the medium of his own motorcar, \\ntouching them as he drove in a medley of stylized postures. Each would place his lips on \\nthose bleeding apertures, lay his own nasal septum against the lesions of her left hand, \\npress his eyelids against the exposed tendon of her forefinger, the dorsal surface of his \\nerect penis against the ruptured lateral walls of her vagina. The automobile crash had \\nmade possible the final and longed-for union of the actress and the members of her \\naudience. (Pp. 189-90) \\n\\n\\nTechnology is never grasped except in the (automobile) accident, that is to say in the \\nviolence done to technology itself and in the violence done to the body. It is the same: \\nany shock, any blow, any impact, all the metallurgy of the accident can be read in the \\nsemiurgy of the body - neither an anatomy nor a physiology, but a semiurgy of \\ncontusions, scars, mutilations, wounds that are so many new sexual organs opened on the \\nbody. In this way, gathering the body as labor in the order of production is opposed to the \\ndispersion of the body as anagram in the order of mutilation. Goodbye \"erogeneous \\nzones\": everything becomes a hole to offer itself to the discharge reflex. But above all (as \\nin primitive initiation tortures, which are not ours), the whole body becomes a sign to \\noffer itself to the exchange of bodily signs. Body and technology diffracting their \\n\\n\\nbewildered signs through each other. Carnal abstraction and design. \\n\\nNo affect behind all that, no psychology, no flux or desire, no libido or death drive. \\nNaturally, death is implicated in an unlimited exploration of the possible violence done to \\nthe body, but this is never, as in sadism or masochism, with an express and perverse aim \\nof violence, a distortion of meaning and of sex (in relation to what?). No repressed \\nunconscious (affects or representations), except in a second reading that would still \\nreinject a forced meaning, based on the psychoanalytic model. The non-meaning, the \\nsavagery, of this mixture of the body and of technology is immanent, it is the immediate \\nreversion of one to the other, and from this results a sexuality without precedent - a sort \\nof potential vertigo linked to the pure inscription of the empty signs of this body. \\nSymbolic ritual of incision and marks, like the graffiti on New York subways. \\n\\nAnother point in common: it is no longer a question, in Crash, of accidental signs that \\nwould only appear at the margins of the system. The Accident is no longer this interstitial \\nbricolage that it still is in the highway accident - the residual bricolage of the death drive \\nfor the new leisure classes. The car is not the appendix of a domestic, immobile universe, \\nthere is no longer a private and domestic universe, there are only incessant figures of \\ncirculation, and the Accident is everywhere, the elementary, irreversible figure, the \\nbanality of the anomaly of death. It is no longer at the margin, it is at the heart. It is no \\nlonger the exception to a triumphal rationality, it has become the Rule, it has devoured \\nthe Rule. It is no longer even the \"accursed share,\" the one conceded to destiny by the \\nsystem itself, and included in its general reckoning. Everything is reversed. It is the \\nAccident that gives form to life, it is the Accident, the insane, that is the sex of life. And \\nthe automobile, the magnetic sphere of the automobile, which ends by investing the entire \\nuniverse with its tunnels, highways, toboggans, exchangers, its mobile dwelling as \\nuniversal prototype, is nothing but the immense metaphor of life. \\n\\nDysfunction is no longer possible in a universe of the accident - therefore no perversion \\nis either. The Accident, like death, is no longer of the order of the neurotic, the repressed, \\nthe residual or the transgressive, it is the instigator of a new mode of nonperverse \\npleasure (contrary to the author himself, who speaks in the introduction of a new perverse \\nlogic, one must resist the moral temptation of reading Crash as perversion), of a strategic \\norganization of life that starts from death. Death, wounds, mutilations are no longer \\nmetaphors of castration, exactly the opposite - not even the opposite. Only the fetishistic \\nmetaphor is perverse, seduction via the model, via the interposed fetish, or via the \\nmedium of language. Here, death and sex are read on the same level as the body, without \\nphantasms, without metaphor, without sentences - different from the Machine of The \\nPenal Colony, where the body in its wounds is still only the support of a textual \\ninscription. Thus one, Kafka\\'s machine, is still puritan, repressive, \"a signifying \\nmachine\" Deleuze would say, whereas the technology in Crash is shining, seductive, or \\ndull and innocent. Seductive because denuded of meaning, and because it is the simple \\nmirror of tom-up bodies. And Vaughan\\'s body is in its turn the mirror of bent chrome, of \\ncrumpled fenders, of sheet iron stained with sperm. Bodies and technology combined, \\nseduced, inextricable. \\n\\n\\nAs Vaughan turned the car into a filling station courtyard the scarlet light from the neon \\n\\n\\n\\nsign over the portico flared across these grainy photographs of appalling injuries: the \\nbreasts of teenage girls deformed by instrument binnacles, the partial mamoplasties . . . \\nnipples sectioned by manufacturers\\' dashboard medallions; injuries to male and female \\ngenitalia caused by steering wheel shrouds, windshields during ejection ... A succession \\nof photographs of mutilated penises, sectioned vulvas and crushed testicles passed \\nthrough the flaring light as Vaughan stood by the girl filling-station attendant at the rear \\nof the car, jocularly talking to her about her body. In several of the photographs the \\nsource of the wound was indicated by a detail of that portion of the car which had caused \\nthe injury: beside a casualty ward photograph of a bifurcated penis was an inset of a \\nhandbrake unit; above a close-up of a massively bruised vulva was a steering-wheel boss \\nand its manufacturer\\'s medallion. These unions of tom genitalia and sections of car body \\nand instrument panel formed a series of disturbing modules, units in a new currency of \\npain and desire. (P. 134) \\n\\n\\nEach mark, each trace, each scar left on the body is like an artificial invagination, like the \\nscarifications of savages, which are always a vehement response to the absence of the \\nbody. Only the wounded body exists symbolically - for itself and for others - \"sexual \\ndesire\" is never anything but the possiblity bodies have of combining and exchanging \\ntheir signs. Now, the few natural orifices to which one usually attaches sex and sexual \\nactivities are nothing next to all the possible wounds, all the artificial orifices (but why \\n\"artificial\"?), all the breaches through which the body is reversibilized and, like certain \\ntopological spaces, no longer knows either interior nor exterior. Sex as we know it is \\nnothing but a minute and specialized definition of all the symbolic and sacrificial \\npractices to which a body can open itself, no longer though nature, but through artifice, \\nthrough the simulacrum, through the accident. Sex is nothing but this rarefaction of a \\ndrive called desire on previously prepared zones. It is largely overtaken by the fan of \\nsymbolic wounds, which is in some sense the ana-grammatization of sex on the whole \\nlength of the body - but now precisely, it is no longer sex, it is something else, sex, itself, \\nis nothing but the inscription of a privileged signifier and some secondary marks - \\nnothing next to the exchange of all the signs and wounds of which the body is capable. \\nThe savages knew how to use the whole body to this end, in tattooing, torture, initiation - \\nsexuality was only one of the possible metaphors of symbolic exchange, neither the most \\nsignificant, nor the most prestigious, as it has become for us in its obsessional and \\nrealistic reference, thanks to its organic and functional character (including in orgasm). \\n\\nAs the car travelled for the first time at twenty miles an hour Vaughan drew his fingers \\nfrom the girl\\'s vulva and anus, rotated his hips and inserted his penis in her vagina. \\nHeadlamps flared above us as the stream of cars moved up the slope of the overpass. In \\nthe rear-view mirror I could still see Vaughan and the girl, their bodies lit by the car \\nbehind, reflected in the black trunk of the Lincoln and a hundred points of the interior \\ntrim. In the chromium ashtray I saw the girl\\'s left breast and erect nipple. In the vinyl \\nwindow gutter I saw deformed sections of Vaughan\\'s thighs and her abdomen forming a \\nbizarre anatomical junction. Vaughan lifted the young woman astride him, his penis \\nentering her vagina again. In a triptych of images reflected in the speedometer, the clock \\nand revolution counter, the sexual act between Vaughan and this young woman took \\nplace in the hooded grottoes of these luminescent dials, moderated by the surging needle \\nof the speedometer. The jutting carapace of the instrument panel and the stylized \\n\\n\\n\\nsculpture of the steering column shroud reflected a dozen images of her rising and falling \\nbuttocks. As I propelled the car at fifty miles an hour along the open deck of the overpass \\nVaughan arched his back and lifted the young woman into the full glare of the headlamps \\nbehind us. Her sharp breasts flashed within the chromium and glass cage of the speeding \\ncar. Vaughan\\'s strongpelvic spasms coincided with the thudding passage of the lamp \\nstandards anchored in the overpass at hundred-yard intervals. As each one approached his \\nhips kicked into the girl, driving his penis into her vagina, his hands splaying her \\nbuttocks to reveal her anus as the yellow light filled the car. (R 143) \\n\\n\\nHere, all the erotic terms are technical. No ass, no dick, no cunt but: the anus, the rectum, \\nthe vulva, the penis, coitus. No slang, that is to say no intimacy of sexual violence, but a \\nfunctional language: the adequation of chrome and mucous as of one form to another. \\n\\nThe same goes for the correspondence of death and sex: it is more as if they are covered \\ntogether in a sort of technical superdesign than articulated according to pleasure. Besides, \\nit is not a question of orgasm, but of pure and simple discharge. And the coitus and sperm \\nthat traverse the book have no more sensual value than the filigree of wounds has violent \\nmeaning, even metaphorically speaking. They are nothing but signatures - in the final \\nscene, X imprints the car wrecks with his sperm. \\n\\nPleasure (whether perverse or not) was always mediated by a technical apparatus, by a \\nmechanism of real objects but more often of phantasms - it always implies an \\nintermediary manipulation of scenes or gadgets. Here, pleasure is only orgasm, that is to \\nsay, confused on the same wave length with the violence of the technical apparatus, and \\nhomogenized by the only technique, one summed up by a single object: the automobile. \\n\\n\\nWe had entered an immense traffic jam. From the junction of the motorway and Western \\nAvenue to the ascent ramp of the flyover the traffic lanes were packed with vehicles, \\nwindshields bleaching out the molten colours of the sun setting above the western \\nsuburbs of London. Brake-lights flared in the evening air, glowing in the huge pool of \\ncellulosed bodies. Vaughan sat with one arm out of the passenger window. He slapped \\nthe door impatiently, pounding the panel with his fist. To our right the high wall of a \\ndouble-decker airline coach formed a cliff of faces. The passengers at the windows \\nresembled rows of the dead looking down at us from the galleries of a columbarium. The \\nenormous energy of the twentieth century, enough to drive the planet into a new orbit \\naround a happier star, was being expended to maintain this immense motionless pause. \\n\\n(P.151) \\n\\nAround me, down the entire length of Western Avenue, along both ramps of the flyover, \\nstretched an immense congestion of traffic held up by the accident. Standing at the centre \\nof this paralysed hurricane, I felt completely at ease, as if my obsessions with the \\nendlessly multiplying vehicles had at last been relieved. (P. 156) \\n\\n\\nYet in Crash, another dimension is inseparable from the confused ones of technology and \\nof sex (united in a work of death that is never a work of mourning): it is that of the \\nphotograph and of cinema. The shining and saturated surface of traffic and of the \\n\\n\\n\\naccident is without depth, but it is always doubled in Vaughan\\'s camera lens. The lens \\nstockpiles and hoards accident photos like dossiers. The general repetition of the crucial \\nevent that it foments (his automobile death and the simultaneous death of the star in a \\ncollision with Elizabeth Taylor, a crash meticulously simulated and refined over a period \\nof months) occurs outside a cinematographic take. This universe would be nothing \\nwithout this hyperreal disconnection. Only the doubling, the unfolding of the visual \\nmedium in the second degree can produce the fusion of technology, sex, and death. But \\nin fact, the photograph here is not a medium nor is it of the order of representation. It is \\nnot a question of a \"supplementary\" abstraction of the image, nor of a spectacular \\ncompulsion, and Vaughan\\'s position is never that of the voyeur or the pervert. The \\nphotographic film (like transistorized music in automobiles and apartments) is part of the \\nuniversal, hyperreal, metallized, and corporeal layer of traffic and flows. The photo is no \\nmore of a medium than technology or the body - all are simultaneous in a universe where \\nthe anticipation of the event coincides with its reproduction, indeed with its \"real\" \\nproduction. No more temporal depth either - just like the past, the future ceases to exist in \\nturn. In fact, it is the eye of the camera that is substituted for time, just as it is for any \\nother depth, that of affect, space, language. It is not another dimension, it simply signfies \\nthat this universe is without secrets. \\n\\n\\nThe mannequin rider sat well back, the onrushing air lifting his chin. His hands were \\nshackled to the handlebars like a ka mi kaze pilot\\'s. His long thorax was plastered with \\nmetering devices. In front of him, their expressions equally vacant, the family of four \\nmannequins sat in their vehicle. Their faces were marked with cryptic symbols. \\n\\nA harsh whipping noise came toward us, the sound of the metering coils skating along \\nthe grass beside the rail. There was a violent metallic explosion as the motorcycle struck \\nthe front of the saloon car. The two vehicles veered sideways towards the line of startled \\nspectators. I regained my balance, involuntarily holding Vaughan\\'s shoulder, as the \\nmotorcycle and its driver sailed over the bonnet of the car and struck the windshield, then \\ncareened across the roof in a black mass of fragments. The car plunged ten feet back on \\nits hawsers. It came to rest astride the rails. The bonnet, windshield and roof had been \\ncrushed by the impact. Inside the cabin, the lopsided family lurched across each other, \\nthe decapitated torso of the front-seat woman passenger embedded in the fractured \\nwindshield . . . Shavings of fibreglass from its face and shoulders speckled the glass \\naround the test car like silver snow, a death confetti. Helen Remington held my arm. She \\nsmiled at me, nodding encouragingly as if urging a child across some mental hurdle. \"We \\ncan have a look at it again on the Ampex. They\\'re showing it in slow-motion.\" (Pp. 124- \\n25) \\n\\n\\nIn Crash, everything is hyperfunctional, since traffic and accident, technology and death, \\nsex and simulation are like a single, large synchronous machine. It is the same universe \\nas that of the hypermarket, where the commodity becomes \"hypercom-modity,\" that is to \\nsay itself always already captured, and the whole atmosphere with it, in the incessant \\nfigures of traffic. But at the same time, the functionalism of Crash devours its own \\nrationality, because it does not know dysfunction. It is a radical functionalism that \\nreaches its paradoxical limits and burns them. At once it again becomes an indefinable, \\n\\n\\n\\ntherefore fascinating, object. Neither good nor bad: ambivalent. Like death or fashion, it \\nbecomes all of a sudden an object at the crossroads, whereas good old functionalism, \\neven contested, no longer is at all - that is to say, it becomes a path leading more quickly \\nthan the main road, or leading where the main road does not lead or, better yet, and to \\nparody Littre in a pataphysical mode, \"a path leading nowhere, but leading there faster \\nthan the others.\" \\n\\nThis is what distinguishes Crash from all science fiction or almost all, which most of the \\ntime still revolves around the old couple function/dysfunction, which it projects in the \\nfuture along the same lines of force and the same finalities that are those of the normal \\nuniverse. There fiction surpasses reality (or the opposite), but according to the same rules \\nof the game. In Crash, no more fiction or reality, it is hyperreality that abolishes both. \\n\\nNot even a critical regression is possible. This mutating and commutating world of \\nsimulation and death, this violently sexed world, but one without desire, full of violated \\nand violent bodies, as if neutralized, this chromatic world and metallic intensity, but one \\nvoid of sensuality, hypertechnology without finality - is it good or bad? We will never \\nknow. It is simply fascinating, though this fascination does not imply a value judgement. \\nThere lies the miracle of Crash. Nowhere does this moral gaze surface - the critical \\njudgment that is still part of the functionality of the old world. Crash is hypercriticism \\n(there also in contrast to its author who, in the introduction, speaks of the \"warning \\nagainst that brutal, erotic, and overlit realm that beckons more and more persuasively to \\nus from the margins of the technological landscape\"*2). Few books, few films reach this \\nresolution of all finality or critical negativity, this dull splendor of banality or of violence. \\nNashville, Clockwork Orange. \\n\\nAfter Borges, but in another register, Crash is the first great novel of the universe of \\nsimulation, the one with which we will all now be concerned - a symbolic universe, but \\none which, through a sort of reversal of the mass-mediated substance (neon, concrete, \\ncar, erotic machinery), appears as if traversed by an intense force of initiation. \\n\\n\\nThe last of the amublances drove away, its siren wailing. The spectators returned to their \\ncars, or climbed the embankment to the break in the wire fence. An adolescent girl in a \\ndenim suit walked past us, her young man with an arm around her waist. He held her \\nright breast with the back of his hand, stroking her nipple with his knuckles. They \\nstepped into a beach buggy slashed with pennants and yellow paint and drove off, hom \\nhooting eccentrically. A burly man in a truck-driver\\'s jacket helped his wife up the \\nembankment, a hand on her buttocks. This pervasive sexuality filled the air, as if we were \\nmembers of a congregation leaving after a sermon urging us to celebrate our sexualities \\nwith friends and strangers, and were driving into the night to imitate the bloody eucharist \\nwe had observed with the most unlikely partners. (R 157) \\n\\n* NOTES * \\n\\n1. J. G. Ballard, Crash (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1973). \\n\\n\\n2. This introduction first appeared in the French edition published in Paris by Clamann- \\nFevy in 1974.-TRANS. \\n\\n\\n\\nSIMULACRA AND SCIENCE FICTION \\n\\n\\nThree orders of simulacra: \\n\\nsimulacra that are natural, naturalist, founded on the image, on imitation and counterfeit, \\nthat are harmonious, optimistic, and that aim for the restitution or the ideal institution of \\nnature made in God\\'s image; \\n\\nsimulacra that are productive, productivist, founded on energy, force, its materialization \\nby the machine and in the whole system of production - a Promethean aim of a \\ncontinuous globalization and expansion, of an indefinite liberation of energy (desire \\nbelongs to the Utopias related to this order of simulacra); \\n\\nsimulacra of simulation, founded on information, the model, the cybernetic game - total \\noperationality, hyperreality, aim of total control. \\n\\nTo the first category belongs the imaginary of the Utopia. To the second corresponds \\nscience fiction, strictly speaking. To the third corresponds - is there an imaginary that \\nmight correspond to this order? The most likely answer is that the good old imaginary of \\nscience fiction is dead and that something else is in the process of emerging (not only in \\nfiction but in theory as well). The same wavering and indeterminate fate puts an end to \\nscience fiction - but also to theory, as specific genres. \\n\\nThere is no real, there is no imaginary except at a certain distance. What happens when \\nthis distance, including that between the real and the imaginary, tends to abolish itself, to \\nbe reabsorbed on behalf of the model? Well, from one order of simulacra to another, the \\ntendency is certainly toward the reabsorption of this distance, of this gap that leaves room \\nfor an ideal or critical projection. \\n\\nThis projection is maximized in the Utopian, in which a transcendent sphere, a radically \\ndifferent universe takes form (the romantic dream is still the individualized form of \\nUtopia, in which transcendence is outlined in depth, even in unconscious structures, but \\nin any case the dissociation from the real world is maximized, the island of Utopia stands \\nopposed to the continent of the real). \\n\\nThis projection is greatly reduced in science fiction: it is most often nothing other than an \\nunbounded projection of the real world of production, but it is not qualitatively different \\nfrom it. Mechanical or energetic extensions, speed, and power increase to the nth power, \\nbut the schemas and the scenarios are those of mechanics, metallurgy, etc. Projected \\nhypostasis of the robot. (To the limited universe of the preindustrial era, Utopia opposed \\nan ideal, alternative universe. To the potentially infinite universe of production, science \\nfiction adds the multiplication of its own possibilities.) \\n\\nThis projection is totally reabsorbed in the implosive era of models. The models no \\nlonger constitute either transcendence or projection, they no longer constitute the \\nimaginary in relation to the real, they are themselves an anticipation of the real, and thus \\nleave no room for any sort of fictional anticipation - they are immanent, and thus leave no \\n\\n\\nroom for any kind of imaginary transcendence. The field opened is that of simulation in \\nthe cybernetic sense, that is, of the manipulation of these models at every level \\n(scenarios, the setting up of simulated situations, etc.) but then nothing distinguishes this \\noperation from the operation itself and the gestation of the real: there is no more fiction. \\n\\nReality could go beyond fiction: that was the surest sign of the possibility of an ever- \\nincreasing imaginary. But the real cannot surpass the model - it is nothing but its alibi. \\n\\nThe imaginary was the alibi of the real, in a world dominated by the reality principle. \\nToday, it is the real that has become the alibi of the model, in a world controlled by the \\nprinciple of simulation. And, paradoxically, it is the real that has become our true Utopia \\n- but a Utopia that is no longer in the realm of the possible, that can only be dreamt of as \\none would dream of a lost object. \\n\\nPerhaps science fiction from the cybernetic and hyperreal era can only exhaust itself, in \\nits artificial resurrection of \"historical\" worlds, can only try to reconstruct in vitro, down \\nto the smallest details, the perimeters of a prior world, the events, the people, the \\nideologies of the past, emptied of meaning, of their original process, but hallucinatory \\nwith retrospective truth. Thus in Simulacra by Philip K. Dick, the war of Secession. \\nGigantic hologram in three dimensions, in which fiction will never again be a mirror held \\ntoward the future, but a desperate rehallucination of the past. \\n\\nWe can no longer imagine any other universe: the grace of transcendence was taken away \\nfrom us in that respect too. Classical science fiction was that of an expanding universe, \\nbesides, it forged its path in the narratives of spatial exploration, counterparts to the more \\nterrestrial forms of exploration and colonization of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. \\nThere is no relationship of cause and effect there: it is not because terrestrial space today \\nis virtually coded, mapped, registered, saturated, has thus in a sense closed up again in \\nuniversalizing itself - a universal market, not only of merchandise, but of values, signs, \\nmodels, leaving no room for the imaginary - it is not exactly because of this that the \\nexploratory universe (technical, mental, cosmic) of science fiction has also ceased to \\nfunction. But the two are narrowly linked, and they are two versions of the same general \\nprocess of implosion that follows the gigantic process of explosion and expansion \\ncharacteristic of past centuries. When a system reaches its own limits and becomes \\nsaturated, a reversal is produced - something else takes place, in the imaginary as well. \\n\\nUntil now we have always had a reserve of the imaginary - now the coefficient of reality \\nis proportional to the reserve of the imaginary that gives it its specific weight. This is also \\ntrue of geographic and spatial exploration: when there is no longer any virgin territory, \\nand thus one available to the imaginary, when the map covers the whole territory, \\nsomething like the principle of reality disappears. In this way, the conquest of space \\nconstitutes an irreversible crossing toward the loss of the terrestrial referential. There is a \\nhemorrhaging of reality as an internal coherence of a limited universe, once the limits of \\nthis universe recede into infinity. The conquest of space that follows that of the planet is \\nequal to derealizing (dematerializing) human space, or to transferring it into a hyperreal \\nof simulation. Witness this two-bedroom/kitchen/shower put into orbit, raised to a spatial \\npower (one could say) with the most recent lunar module. The every-dayness of the \\nterrestrial habitat itself elevated to the rank of cosmic value, hypostatized in space - the \\n\\n\\n\\nsatellization of the real in the transcendence of space - it is the end of metaphysics, the \\nend of the phantasm, the end of science fiction - the era of hyper-reality begins. \\n\\nFrom then onward, something must change: the projection, the extrapolation, the sort of \\npantographic excess that constituted the charm of science fiction are all impossible. It is \\nno longer possible to fabricate the unreal from the real, the imaginary from the givens of \\nthe real. The process will, rather, be the opposite: it will be to put decentered situations, \\nmodels of simulation in place and to contrive to give them the feeling of the real, of the \\nbanal, of lived experience, to reinvent the real as fiction, precisely because it has \\ndisappeared from our life. Hallucination of the real, of lived experience, of the quotidian, \\nbut reconstituted, sometimes down to disquietingly strange details, reconstituted as an \\nanimal or vegetal reserve, brought to light with a transparent precision, but without \\nsubstance, derealized in advance, hyperrealized. \\n\\nIn this way, science fiction would no longer be a romantic expansion with all the freedom \\nand naivete that the charm of discovery gave it, but, quite the contrary, it would evolve \\nimplosively in the very image of our current conception of the universe, attempting to \\nrevitalize, reactualize, requotidianize fragments of simulation, fragments of this universal \\nsimulation that have become for us the so-called real world. \\n\\nWhere would the works be that would meet, here and now, this situational inversion, this \\nsituational reversion? Obviously the short stories of Philip K. Dick \"gravitate\" in this \\nspace, if one can use that word (but that is precisely what one can\\'t really do any more, \\nbecause this new universe is \"antigravitational,\" or if it still gravitates, it is around the \\nhole of the real, around the hole of the imaginary). One does not see an alternative \\ncosmos, a cosmic folklore or exoticism, or a galactic prowess there - one is from the start \\nin a total simulation, without origin, immanent, without a past, without a future, a \\ndiffusion of all coordinates (mental, temporal, spatial, signaletic) - it is not about a \\nparallel universe, a double universe, or even a possible universe - neither possible, \\nimpossible, neither real nor unreal: hyperreal - it is a universe of simulation, which is \\nsomething else altogether. And not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra - \\nscience fiction has always done so, but it played on the double, on doubling or \\nredoubling, either artificial or imaginary, whereas here the double has disappeared, there \\nis no longer a double, one is always already in the other world, which is no longer an \\nother, without a mirror, a projection, or a Utopia that can reflect it - simulation is \\ninsuperable, unsurpassable, dull and flat, without exteriority - we will no longer even \\npass through to \"the other side of mirror,\" that was still the golden age of transcendence. \\n\\nPerhaps a still more convincing example would be that of Ballard and of his evolution \\nfrom the first very \"phantasmagoric\" short stories, poetic, dreamlike, disorienting, up to \\nCrash, which is without a doubt (more than IGH or Concrete Island) the current model of \\nthis science fiction that is no longer one. Crash is our world, nothing in it is \"invented\": \\neverything in it is hyper-functional, both the circulation and the accident, technique and \\ndeath, sex and photographic lens, everything in it is like a giant, synchronous, simulated \\nmachine: that is to say the acceleration of our own models, of all models that surround us, \\nblended and hyperoperational in the void. This is what distinguishes Crash from almost \\nall science fiction, which mostly still revolves around the old (mechanical and \\nmechanistic) couple function/ dysfunction, which it projects into the future along the \\n\\n\\n\\nsame lines of force and the same finalities that are those of the \"normal\" universe. Fiction \\nin that universe might surpass reality (or the opposite: that is more subtle) but it still \\nplays by the same rules. In Crash, there is neither fiction nor reality anymore - hyper¬ \\nreality abolishes both. It is there that our contemporary science fiction, if there is one, \\nexists. \"Jack Barron or Eternity\", some passages from \"Everyone to Zanzibar\". \\n\\nIn fact, science fiction in this sense is no longer anywhere, and it is everywhere, in the \\ncirculation of models, here and now, in the very principle of the surrounding simulation. \\n\\nIt can emerge in its crude state, from the inertia itself of the operational world. What \\nwriter of science fiction would have \"imagined\" (but precisely it can no longer be \\n\"imagined\") this \"reality\" of East German factories - simulacra, factories that reemploy \\nall the unemployed to fill all the roles and all the posts of the traditional production \\nprocess but that don\\'t produce anything, whose activity is consumed in a game of orders, \\nof competition, of writing, of bookkeeping, between one factory and another, inside a \\nvast network? All material production is redoubled in the void (one of these simulacra \\nfactories even \"really\" failed, putting its own unemployed out of work a second time). \\nThat is simulation: not that the factories are fake, but precisely that they are real, \\nhyperreal, and that because of this they return all \"real\" production, that of \"serious\" \\nfactories, to the same hyperreality. What is fascinating here is not the opposition between \\nreal factories and fake factories, but on the contrary the lack of distinction between the \\ntwo, the fact that all the rest of production has no greater referent or deeper finality than \\nthis \"simulacra!\" business. It is this hyperreal indifference that constitutes the real \\n\"science-fictional\" quality of this episode. And one can see that it is not necessary to \\ninvent it: it is there, emerging from a world without secrets, without depth. \\n\\nWithout a doubt, the most difficult thing today, in the complex universe of science \\nfiction, is to unravel what still complies (and a large part still does) with the imaginary of \\nthe second order, of the productive/projective order, and what already comes from this \\nvagueness of the imaginary, of this uncertainty proper to the third order of simulation. \\nThus one can clearly mark the difference between the mechanical robot machines, \\ncharacteristic of the second order, and the cybernetic machines, computers, etc., that, in \\ntheir governing principle, depend on the third order. But one order can certainly \\ncontaminate another, and the computer can certainly function as a mechanical \\nsupermachine, a superrobot, a superpower machine, exposing the productive genie of the \\nsimulacra of the second order: the computer does not come into play as a process of \\nsimulation, and it still bears witness to the reflexes of a finalized universe (including \\nambivalence and revolt, like the computer from 2001 or Shalmanezer in Everyone to \\nZanzibar). \\n\\nBetween the operatic (the theatrical status of theatrical and fantastical machinery, the \\n\"grand opera\" of technique) that corresponds to the first order, the operative (the \\nindustrial, productive status, productive of power and energy) that corresponds to the \\nsecond order, and the operational (the cybernetic, aleatory, uncertain status of \\n\"metatechnique\") that corresponds to the third order, all interference can still be produced \\ntoday at the level of science fiction. But only the last order can still truly interest us. \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ANIMALS: TERRITORY AND METAMORPHOSES \\n\\n\\nWhat did the torturers of the Inquisition want? The admission of evil, of the principle of \\nevil. It was necessary to make the accused say that he was not guilty except by accident, \\nthrough the incidence of the principle of Evil in the divine order. Thus confession \\nrestored a reassuring causality, and torture, and the extermination of evil through torture, \\nwere nothing but the triumphal coronation (neither sadistic nor expiatory) of the fact of \\nhaving produced Evil as cause. Otherwise, the least heresy would have rendered all of \\ndivine creation suspect. In the same way, when we use and abuse animals in laboratories, \\nin rockets, with experimental ferocity in the name of science, what confession are we \\nseeking to extort from them from beneath the scalpel and the electrodes? \\n\\nPrecisely the admission of a principle of objectivity of which science is never certain, of \\nwhich it secretly despairs. Animals must be made to say that they are not animals, that \\nbestiality, savagery - with what these terms imply of unintelligibility, radical strangeness \\nto reason - do not exist, but on the contrary the most bestial behaviors, the most singular, \\nthe most abnormal are resolved in science, in physiological mechanisms, in cerebral \\nconnections, etc. Bestiality, and its principle of uncertainty, must be killed in animals. \\n\\nExperimentation is thus not a means to an end, it is a contemporary challenge and torture. \\nIt does not found an intelligibility, it extorts a confession from science as previously one \\nextorted a profession of faith. A confession whose apparent distances - illness, madness, \\nbestiality - are nothing but a provisional crack in the transparency of causality. This \\nproof, as before that of divine reason, must be continually redone and everywhere redone \\n- in this sense we are all animals, and laboratory animals, whom one continually tests in \\norder to extort their reflex behaviors, which are like so many confessions of rationality in \\nthe final moment. Everywhere bestiality must yield to reflex animality, exorcising an \\norder of the indecipherable, of the savage, of which, precisely in their silence, animals \\nhave remained the incarnation for us. \\n\\nAnimals have thus preceded us on the path of liberal extermination. All the aspects of the \\nmodern treatment of animals retrace the vicissitudes of the manipulation of humans, from \\nexperimentation to industrial pressure in breeding. \\n\\n\\nGathered at a convention in Lyons, European veterinarians became concerned about the \\ndiseases and psychological troubles that develop in industrial breeding farms. \\n\\n-Science and the Future, July 1973 \\n\\n\\nRabbits develop a morbid anxiety, they become coprophagous and sterile. The rabbit is \\n\"anxious,\" \"maladapted\" from birth, so it seems. Greater sensitivity to infections, to \\nparasites. The antibodies lose their efficacy, the females become sterile. Spontaneously, \\nif one can say so, mortality increases. \\n\\nThe hysteria of chickens infects the whole group, a \"psychic\" collective tension that can \\nreach a critical threshold: all the animals begin to fly and scream in all directions. The \\n\\n\\ncrisis over, there is a collapse, general terror, the animals take refuge in the corner, mute \\nand as if paralyzed. At the first shock, the crisis begins again. It can last several weeks. \\nOne attempted to give them tranquilizers . . . \\n\\nCannibalism on the part of pigs. The animals wound themselves. The calves begin to lick \\neverything that surrounds them, sometimes even unto death. \\n\\n\"It is certainly necessary to establish that bred animals suffer psychically... A zoo \\npsychiatry becomes necessary... A psychic life of frustration represents an obstacle to \\nnormal development.\" \\n\\nDarkness, red light, gadgets, tranquilizers, nothing works. In birds there is a hierarchy of \\naccess to food - the pecking order. In these conditions of overpopulation, the last in the \\norder is never able to get to the food. One thus wished to break the pecking order and \\ndemocratize access to food through another system of distribution. Failure: the \\ndestruction of this symbolic order brings along with it total confusion for the birds, and a \\nchronic instability. Good example of absurdity: one knows the analogous ravages of good \\ndemocratic intentions in tribal societies. \\n\\nAnimals somatize! Extraordinary discovery! Cancers, gastric ulcers, myocardial \\ninfarction in mice, pigs, chickens! \\n\\nIn conclusion, the author says, it certainly seems that the only remedy is space - \"a bit \\nmore space, and a lot of the problems observed would disappear.\" In any case, \"the fate \\nof these animals would become less miserable.\" He is thus satisfied with this conference: \\n\"The current concern about the fate of bred animals is witness, once again, to the alliance \\nof the morality and the meaning of a well - understood interest.\" \"One cannot simply do \\nwhatever one wants with nature.\" The problems having become serious enough to \\ndamage the profitability of business, this drop in profitability may lead the breeders to \\nreturn the animals to more normal living conditions. \"In order to be raised in a healthy \\nmanner, it is now necessary to be always concerned with the mental equilibrium of the \\nanimals.\" And he foresees the time when one will send animals, like people, to the \\ncountry, to restore their mental equilibrium. \\n\\nOne has never said better how much \"humanism,\" \"normality,\" \"quality of life\" were \\nnothing but the vicissitudes of profitability. The parallel between these animals sick from \\nsurplus value and humans sick from industrial concentration, from the scientific \\norganization of work and assembly - line factories is illuminating. In the latter case as \\nwell, the capitalist \"breeders\" were led to a revision that was destructive of the mode of \\nexploitation, innovating and reinventing the \"quality of work,\" the \"enrichment of tasks,\" \\ndiscovering the \"human\" sciences and the \"psycho-sociological\" dimension of the \\nfactory. Only the inevitability of death renders the example of the animals more shocking \\nstill than that of men on an assembly line. \\n\\nAgainst the industrial organization of death, animals have no other recourse, no other \\npossible defiance, except suicide. All the anomalies described are suicidal. These \\nresistances are a failure of industrial reason (drop in profits), but also one senses that they \\nrun counter to the logical reasoning of the specialists. In the logic of reflex behaviors and \\n\\n\\n\\nof the animal - machine, in rational logic, these anomalies are not qualifiable. One will \\ntherefore bestow on animals a psychic life, an irrational and derailed psychic life, given \\nover to liberal and humanist therapy, without the final objective ever having changed: \\ndeath. \\n\\nWith ingenuity, one thus discovers, like a new and unexplored scientific field, the \\npsychic life of the animal as soon as he is revealed to be maladapted to the death one is \\npreparing for him. In the same way one rediscovers psychology, sociology, the sexuality \\nof prisoners as soon as it becomes impossible to purely and simply incarcerate them.*l \\nOne discovers that the prisoner needs liberty, sexuality, \"normalcy\" to withstand prison, \\njust as industrially bred animals need a certain \"quality of life\" to die within the norm. \\nAnd nothing about this is contradictory. The worker also needs responsibility, self¬ \\nmanagement in order to better respond to the imperative of production. Everyone needs a \\npsychic life to adapt. There is no other reason for the arrival of the psychic life, conscious \\nor unconscious. And its golden age, which still continues, will have coincided with the \\nimpossibility of a rational socialization in every domain. Never would the humanities or \\npsychoanalysis have existed if it had been miraculously possible to reduce man to his \\n\"rational\" behaviors. The whole discovery of the psychological, whose complexity can \\nextend ad infinitum, comes from nothing but the impossibility of exploiting to death (the \\nworkers), of incarcerating to death (the detained), of fattening to death (the animals), \\naccording to the strict law of equivalences: \\n\\nso much caloric energy and time = so much work power such an infraction = such an \\nequivalent punishment so much food = optimal weight and industrial death. \\n\\nEverything is blocked, so psychic life, the mental, neurosis, the psychosocial, etc. are \\nbom, not at all in order to break this delirious equation, but to restore the principle of \\nmutually agreed upon equivalences. \\n\\nBeasts of burden, they had to work for man. Beasts of demand, they are summoned to \\nrespond to the interrogation of science.*2 Beasts of consumption, they have become the \\nmeat of industry. Beasts of somatization, they are now made to speak the \"psy\" language, \\nto answer for their psychic life and the misdeeds of their unconscious. Everything has \\nhappened to them that has happened to us. Our destiny has never been separated from \\ntheirs, and this is a sort of bitter revenge on Human Reason, which has become used to \\nupholding the absolute privilege of the Human over the Bestial. \\n\\nBesides, animals were only demoted to the status of inhumanity as reason and humanism \\nprogressed. A logic parallel to that of racism. An objective animal \"reign\" has only \\nexisted since Man has existed. It would take too long to redo the genealogy of their \\nrespective statuses, but the abyss that separates them today, the one that permits us to \\nsend beasts, in our place, to respond to the terrifying universes of space and laboratories, \\nthe one that permits the liquidation of species even as they are archived as specimens in \\nthe African reserves or in the hell of zoos - since there is no more room for them in our \\nculture than there is for the dead - the whole covered by a racist sentimentality (baby \\nseals, Brigitte Bardot), this abyss that separates them follows domestication, just as true \\nracism follows slavery. \\n\\n\\n\\nOnce animals had a more sacred, more divine character than men. There is not even a \\nreign of the \"human\" in primitive societies, and for a long time the animal order has been \\nthe order of reference. Only the animal is worth being sacrificed, as a god, the sacrifice of \\nman only comes afterward, according to a degraded order. Men qualify only by their \\naffiliation to the animal: the Bororos \"are\" macaws. This is not of the prelogical or \\npsychoanalytic order - nor of the mental order of classification, to which Levi-Strauss \\nreduced the animal effigy (even if it is still fabulous that animals served as a language, \\nthis was also part of their divinity)-no, this signifies that Bororos and macaws are part of \\na cycle, and that the figure of the cycle excludes any division of species, any of the \\ndistinctive oppositions upon which we live. The structural opposition is diabolic, it \\ndivides and confronts distinct identities: such is the division of the Human, which throws \\nbeasts into the Inhuman - the cycle, itself, is symbolic: it abolishes the positions in a \\nreversible enchainment - in this sense, the Bororos \"are\" macaws, in the same way that \\nthe Canaque say the dead walk among the living. (Does Deleuze envision something like \\nthat in his becoming-animal and when he says \"Be the rose panther!\"?) \\n\\nWhatever it may be, animals have always had, until our era, a divine or sacrificial \\nnobility that all mythologies recount. Even murder by hunting is still a symbolic relation, \\nas opposed to an experimental dissection. Even domestication is still a symbolic relation, \\nas opposed to industrial breeding. One only has to look at the status of animals in peasant \\nsociety. And the status of domestication, which presupposes land, a clan, a system of \\nparentage of which the animals are a part, must not be confused with the status of the \\ndomestic pet - the only type of animals that are left to us outside reserves and breeding \\nstations - dogs, cats, birds, hamsters, all packed together in the affection of their master. \\nThe trajectory animals have followed, from divine sacrifice to dog cemeteries with \\natmospheric music, from sacred defiance to ecological sentimentality, speaks loudly \\nenough of the vulgarization of the status of man himself - it once again describes an \\nunexpected reciprocity between the two. \\n\\nIn particular, our sentimentality toward animals is a sure sign of the disdain in which we \\nhold them. It is proportional to this disdain. It is in proportion to being relegated to \\nirresponsibility, to the inhuman, that the animal becomes worthy of the human ritual of \\naffection and protection, just as the child does in direct proportion to being relegated to a \\nstatus of innocence and childishness. Sentimentality is nothing but the infinitely degraded \\nform of bestiality, the racist commiseration, in which we ridiculously cloak animals to the \\npoint of rendering them sentimental themselves. \\n\\nThose who used to sacrifice animals did not take them for beasts. And even the Middle \\nAges, which condemned and punished them in due form, was in this way much closer to \\nthem than we are, we who are filled with horror at this practice. They held them to be \\nguilty: which was a way of honoring them. We take them for nothing, and it is on this \\nbasis that we are \"human\" with them. We no longer sacrifice them, we no longer punish \\nthem, and we are proud of it, but it is simply that we have domesticated them, worse: that \\nwe have made of them a racially inferior world, no longer even worthy of our justice, but \\nonly of our affection and social charity, no longer worthy of punishment and of death, but \\nonly of experimentation and extermination like meat from the butchery. \\n\\n\\nIt is the reabsorption of all violence in regard to them that today forms the monstrosity of \\n\\n\\n\\nbeasts. The violence of sacrifice, which is one of \"intimacy\" (Bataille), has been \\nsucceeded by the sentimental or experimental violence that is one of distance. \\n\\nMonstrosity has changed in meaning. The original monstrosity of the beast, object of \\nterror and fascination, but never negative, always ambivalent, object of exchange also \\nand of metaphor, in sacrifice, in mythology, in the heraldic bestiary, and even in our \\ndreams and our phantasms - this monstrosity, rich in every threat and every \\nmetamorphosis, one that is secretly resolved in the living culture of men, and that is a \\nform of alliance, has been exchanged for a spectacular monstrosity: that of King Kong \\nwrenched from his jungle and transformed into a music-hall star. Formerly, the cultural \\nhero annihilated the beast, the dragon, the monster - and from the spilt blood plants, men, \\nculture were born; today, it is the beast King Kong who comes to sack our industrial \\nmetropolises, who comes to liberate us from our culture, a culture dead from having \\npurged itself of all real monstrosity and from having broken its pact with it (which was \\nexpressed in the film by the primitive gift of the woman). The profound seduction of the \\nfilm comes from this inversion of meaning: all inhumanity has gone over to the side of \\nmen, all humanity has gone over to the side of captive bestiality, and to the respective \\nseduction of man and of beast, monstrous seduction of one order by the other, the human \\nand the bestial. Kong dies for having renewed, through seduction, this possibility of the \\nmetamorphosis of one reign into another, this incestuous promiscuity between beasts and \\nmen (though one that is never realized, except in a symbolic and ritual mode). \\n\\nIn the end, the progression that the beast followed is not different form that of madness \\nand childhood, of sex or negritude. A logic of exclusion, of reclusion, of discrimination \\nand necessarily, in return, a logic of reversion, reversible violence that makes it so that all \\nof society finally aligns itself on the axioms of madness, of childhood, of sexuality, and \\nof inferior races (purged, it must be said, of the radical interrogation to which, from the \\nvery heart of their exclusion, they lent importance). The convergence of processes of \\ncivilization is astounding. Animals, like the dead, and so many others, have followed this \\nuninterrupted process of annexation through extermination, which consists of liquidation, \\nthen of making the extinct species speak, of making them present the confession of their \\ndisappearance. Making animals speak, as one has made the insane, children, sex \\n(Foucault) speak. This is even deluded in regard to animals, whose principle of \\nuncertainty, which they have caused to weigh on men since the rupture in their alliance \\nwith men, resides in the fact that they do not speak. \\n\\nThe challenge of madness has historically been met by the hypothesis of the unconscious. \\nThe Unconscious is this logistical mechanism that permits us to think madness (and more \\ngenerally all strange and anomalous formations) in a system of meaning opened to \\nnonmeaning, which will make room for the terrors of the nonsensical, now intelligible \\nunder the auspices of a certain discourse: psychic life, drive, repression, etc. The mad \\nwere the ones who forced us to the hypothesis of the unconscious, but we are the ones in \\nreturn who have trapped them there. Because if, initially, the Unconscious seems to turn \\nagainst Reason and to bring to it a radical subversion, if it still seems charged with the \\npotential of the rupture of madness, later it turns against madness, because it is what \\nenables madness to be annexed to a reason more universal than classical reason. \\n\\n\\nThe mad, once mute, today are heard by everyone; one has found the grid on which to \\n\\n\\n\\ncollect their once absurd and indecipherable messages. Children speak, to the adult \\nuniverse they are no longer those simultaneously strange and insignificant beings - \\nchildren signify, they have become significant - not through some sort of \"liberation\" of \\ntheir speech, but because adult reason has given itself the most subtle means to avert the \\nthreat of their silence. The primitives also are heard, one seeks them out, one listens to \\nthem, they are no longer beasts. Levi-Strauss pointed out that their mental structures were \\nthe same as ours, psychoanalysis rallied them to Oedipus, and to the libido - all of our \\ncodes functioned well, and they responded to them. One had buried them under silence, \\none buries them beneath speech, \"different\" speech certainly, but beneath the word of the \\nday, \"difference,\" as formerly one did beneath the unity of Reason; let us not be misled \\nby this, it is the same order that is advancing. The imperialism of reason, neoimperialism \\nof difference. \\n\\nWhat is essential is that nothing escape the empire of meaning, the sharing of meaning. \\nCertainly, behind all that, nothing speaks to us, neither the mad, nor the dead, nor \\nchildren, nor savages, and fundamentally we know nothing of them, but what is essential \\nis that Reason save face, and that everything escape silence. \\n\\nThey, the animals, do not speak. In a universe of increasing speech, of the constraint to \\nconfess and to speak, only they remain mute, and for this reason they seem to retreat far \\nfrom us, behind the horizon of truth. But it is what makes us intimate with them. It is not \\nthe ecological problem of their survival that is important, but still and always that of their \\nsilence. In a world bent on doing nothing but making one speak, in a world assembled \\nunder the hegemony of signs and discourse, their silence weighs more and more heavily \\non our organization of meaning. \\n\\nCertainly, one makes them speak, and with all means, some more innocent than others. \\nThey spoke the moral discourse of man in fables. They supported structural discourse in \\nthe theory of totemism. Every day they deliver their \"objective\" - anatomical, \\nphysiological, genetic - message in laboratories. They served in turns as metaphors for \\nvirtue and vice, as an energetic and ecological model, as a mechanical and formal model \\nin bionics, as a phantasmatic register for the unconscious and, lastly, as a model for the \\nabsolute deterritorialization of desire in Deleuze\\'s \"becoming-animal\" (paradoxical: to \\ntake the animal as a model of deterritorialization when he is the territorial being par \\nexcellence). \\n\\nIn all this - metaphor, guinea pig, model, allegory (without forgetting their alimentary \\n\"use value\") - animals maintain a compulsory discourse. Nowhere do they really speak, \\nbecause they only furnish the responses one asks for. It is their way of sending the \\nHuman back to his circular codes, behind which their silence analyzes us. \\n\\nOne never escapes the reversion that follows any kind of exclusion. Refusing reason to \\nmadmen leads sooner or later to dismantling the bases of this reason - the mad take \\nrevenge in some way. Refusing animals the unconscious, repression, the symbolic \\n(confused with language) is, one can hope, sooner or later (in a sort of disconnection \\nsubsequent to that of madness and of the unconscious) to put in question once again the \\nvalidity of these concepts, just as they govern and distinguish us today. Because, if \\nformerly the privilege of Man was founded on the monopoly of consciousness, today it is \\n\\n\\n\\nfounded on the monopoly of the unconscious. \\n\\n\\nAnimals have no unconscious, this is well known. Without a doubt, they dream, but this \\nis a conjecture of a bioelectrical order, and they lack language, which alone gives \\nmeaning to the dream by inscribing it in the symbolic order. We can fantasize about \\nthem, project our fantasies on them and think we are sharing this mise-en-scene. But this \\nis comfortable for us - in fact animals are not intelligible to us either under the regime of \\nconsciousness or under that of the unconscious. Therefore, it is not a question of forcing \\nthem to it, but just the opposite of seeing in what way they put in question this very \\nhypothesis of the unconscious, and to what other hypothesis they force us. Such is the \\nmeaning, or the non-meaning of their silence. \\n\\nSuch was the silence of madmen that it forced us to the hypothesis of the unconscious - \\nsuch is the resistance of animals that it forces us to change hypotheses. For if to us they \\nare and will remain unintelligible, yet we live in some kind of understanding with them. \\nAnd if we live in this way, under the sign of a general ecology where in a sort of \\nplanetary niche, which is only the enlarged dimension of the Platonic cave, the ghosts of \\nanimals and the natural elements would come to rub against the shadow of men who \\nsurvived the political economy - no, our profound understanding with beasts, even on the \\nroad to disappearance, is placed under the conjugated sign, opposite in appearance, of \\nmetamorphosis and of territory. \\n\\nNothing seems more fixed in the perpetuation of the species than animals, but yet they \\nare for us the image of metamorphosis, of all possible metamorphoses. Nothing more \\nerrant, more nomadic in appearance than animals, and yet their law is that of the territory. \\n*3 But one must push aside all the countermeanings on this notion of territory. It is not at \\nall the enlarged relation of a subject or of a group to its own space, a sort of organic right \\nto private property of the individual, of the clan or of the species - such is the phantasm \\nof psychology and of sociology extended to all of ecology - nor this sort of vital function, \\nof an environmental bubble where the whole system of needs is summed up.*4 A \\nterritory is also not a space, with what this term implies for us about liberty and \\nappropriation. Neither instinct, nor need, nor structure (be it \"cultural\" and \"behavioral\"), \\nthe notion of territory is also opposed in some way to that of the unconscious. The \\nunconscious is a \"buried,\" repressed, and indefinitely subdivided structure. The territory \\nis open and circumscribed. The unconscious is the site of the indefinite repetition of \\nsubjective repression and fantasies. The territory is the site of a completed cycle of \\nparentage and exchanges - without a subject, but without exception: animal and vegetal \\ncycle, cycle of goods and wealth, cycle of parentage and the species, cycle of women and \\nritual - there is no subject and everything is exchanged. The obligations are absolute \\ntherein - total reversibility - but no one knows death there, since all is metamorphosed. \\nNeither subject, nor death, nor unconscious, nor repression, since nothing stops the \\nenchainment of forms. \\n\\nAnimals have no unconscious, because they have a territory. Men have only had an \\nunconscious since they lost a territory. At once territories and metamorphoses have been \\ntaken from them - the unconscious is the individual structure of mourning in which this \\nloss is incessantly, hopelessly replayed - animals are the nostalgia for it. The question \\nthat they raise for us would thus be this one: don\\'t we live now and already, beyond the \\n\\n\\n\\neffects of the linearity and the accumulation of reason, beyond the effects of the \\nconscious and unconscious, according to this brute, symbolic mode, of indefinite cycling \\nand reversion over a finite space? And beyond the ideal schema that is that of our culture, \\nof all culture maybe, of the accumulation of energy, and of the final liberation, don\\'t we \\ndream of implosion rather than of explosion, of metamorphosis rather than energy, of \\nobligation and ritual defiance rather than of liberty, of the territorial cycle rather than of . \\n\\n. . But the animals do not ask questions. They are silent. \\n\\n* NOTES * \\n\\n1. Thus, in Texas, four hundred men and one hundred women experiment with the \\nsweetest penitentiary in the world. A child was born there last June and there were only \\nthree escapes in two years. The men and women take their meals together and get \\ntogether outside of group therapy sessions. Each prisoner possesses the only key to his \\nindividual room. Couples are able to be alone in the empty rooms. To this day, thirty-five \\nprisoners have escaped, but for the most part they have returned of their own accord. \\n\\n2. In French, betes de somme means beasts of burden. Baudrillard plays with the word \\nsomme in the phrase that follows: \"Betes de sommation, elles sont sommees de repondre \\na l\\'interrogatoire de la science,\" and in the use of the word consommation in the \\nfollowing phrase.-TRANS. \\n\\n3. That animals wander is a myth, and the current representation of the unconscious and \\nof desire as erratic and nomadic belongs to the same \"order. Animals have never \\nwandered, were never de territorialized. A whole liberatory phantasmagoria is drawn in \\nopposition to the constraints of modern society, a representation of nature and of beasts \\nas savagery, as the freedom to \"fulfill all needs,\" today \"of realizing all his desires\" - \\nbecause modern Rousseauism has taken the form of the indeterminacy of drive, of the \\nwandering of desire and of the nomadism of infinitude - but it is the same mystique of \\nunleashed, noncoded forces with no finality other than their own eruption. \\n\\nNow, free, virgin nature, without limits or territories, where each wanders at will, never \\nexisted, except in the imaginary of the dominant order, of which this nature is the \\nequivalent mirror. We project (nature, desire, animality, rhizome . . .) the very schema of \\ndeterritorialization that is that of the economic system and of capital as ideal savagery. \\nLiberty is nowhere but in capital, it is what produced it, it is what deepens it. There is \\nthus an exact correlation between the social legislation of value (urban, industrial, \\nrepressive, etc.) and the imaginary savagery one places in opposition to it: they are both \\n\"deterritorialized\" and in each other\\'s image. Moreover, the radicality of \"desire,\" one \\nsees this in current theories, increases at the same rate as civilized abstraction, not at all \\nantagonistically, but absolutely according to the same movement, that of the same form \\nalways more decoded, more decentered, \"freer,\" which simultaneously envelops our real \\nand our imaginary. Nature, liberty, desire, etc., do not even express a dream the opposite \\nof capital, they directly translate the progress or the ravages of this culture, they even \\nanticipate it, because they dream of total deterritorialization where the system never \\nimposes anything but what is relative: the demand of \"liberty\" is never anything but \\ngoing further than the system, but in the same direction. \\n\\n\\n\\nNeither the beasts nor the savages know \"nature\" in our way: they only know territories, \\nlimited, marked, which are spaces of insurmountable reciprocity. \\n\\n4. Thus, Henri Laborit refuses the interpretation of territory in terms of instinct or private \\nproperty: \"One has never brought forth as evidence, either in the hypothalamus or \\nelsewhere, either a cellular group or neural pathways that are differentiated in relation to \\nthe notion of territory... No territorial center seems to exist... It is not useful to appeal to a \\nparticular instinct\" - but it is useful to do so in order to better return it to a functionality \\nof needs extended to include cultural behaviors, which today is the vulgate common to \\neconomics, psychology, sociology, etc.: \"The territory thus becomes the space necessary \\nto the realization of the act of bestowing, the vital space... The bubble, the territory thus \\nrepresent the morsel of space in immediate contact with the organism, the one in which it \\n\\'opens\\' its thermodynamic exchanges in order to maintain its own structure... With the \\ngrowing interdependence of human individuals, with the promiscuity that characterizes \\nthe great modem cities, the individual bubble has shrunk considerably...\" Spatial, \\nfunctional, homeostatic conception. As if the stake of a group or of a man, even of an \\nanimal, were the equilibrium of his bubble and the homeostasis of his exchanges, internal \\nand external! \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE REMAINDER \\n\\n\\nWhen everything is taken away, nothing is left. \\n\\nThis is false. \\n\\nThe equation of everything and nothing, the subtraction of the remainder, is totally false. \\n\\nIt is not that there is no remainder. But this remainder never has an autonomous reality, \\nnor its own place: it is what partition, circumscription, exclusion designate... what else? It \\nis through the subtraction of the remainder that reality is founded and gathers strength... \\nwhat else? \\n\\nWhat is strange is precisely that there is no opposing term in a binary opposition: one can \\nsay the right/the left, the same/the other, the majority/the minority, the crazy/the normal, \\netc. - but the remainder/ ? Nothing on the other side of the slash. \\n\\n\"The sum and the remainder,\" the addition and the remainder, the operation and the \\nremainder are not distinctive oppositions. \\n\\nAnd yet, what is on the other side of the remainder exists, it is even the marked term, the \\npowerful moment, the privileged element in this strangely asymmetrical opposition, in \\nthis structure that is not one. But this marked term has no name. It is anonymous, it is \\nunstable and without definition. Positive, but only the negative gives it the force of \\nreality. In a strict sense, it cannot be defined except as the remainder of the remainder. \\n\\nThus the remainder refers to much more than a clear division in two localized terms, to a \\nturning and reversible structure, an always imminent structure of reversion, in which one \\nnever knows which is the remainder of the other. In no other structure can one create this \\nreversion, or this mise-en-abyme: the masculine is not the feminine of the feminine, the \\nnormal is not the crazy of the crazy, the right is not the left of the left, etc. Perhaps only \\nin the mirror can the question be posed: which, the real or the image, is the reflection of \\nthe other? In this sense one can speak of the remainder as a mirror, or of the mirror of the \\nremainder. It is that in both cases the line of structural demarcation, the line of the \\nsharing of meaning, has become a wavering one, it is that meaning (most literally: the \\npossibility of going from one point to another according to a vector determined by the \\nrespective position of the terms) no longer exists. There is no longer a respective position \\n- the real disappearing to make room for an image, more real than the real, and \\nconversely - the remainder disappearing from the assigned location to resurface inside \\nout, in what it was the remainder of, etc. \\n\\nThe same is true of the social. Who can say if the remainder of the social is the residue of \\nthe nonsocialized, or if it is not the social itself that is the remainder, the gigantic waste \\nproduct... of what else? Of a process, which even if it were to completely disappear and \\nhad no name except the social would nevertheless only be its remainder. The residue can \\nbe completely at the level of the real. When a system has absorbed everything, when one \\nhas added everything up, when nothing remains, the entire sum turns to the remainder \\n\\n\\nand becomes the remainder. \\n\\n\\nWitness the \"Society\" column of Le Monde, in which paradoxically, only immigrants, \\ndelinquents, women, etc. appear - everything that has not been socialized, \"social\" cases \\nanalogous to pathological cases. Pockets to be reabsorbed, segments that the \"social\" \\nisolates as it grows. Designated as \"residual\" at the horizon of the social, they enter its \\njurisdiction in this way and are destined to find their place in an enlarged sociality. It is \\nfor this remainder that the social machine is recharged and finds new energy. But what \\nhappens when everything is sponged up, when everything is socialized? Then the \\nmachine stops, the dynamic is reversed, and it is the whole social system that becomes \\nresidue. As the social in its progression eliminates all the residue, it itself becomes \\nresidual. In designating residual categories as \"Society,\" the social designates itself as a \\nremainder. \\n\\nThe impossibility of determining what is the remainder of the other characterizes the \\nphase of simulation and the death throes of distinctive systems, a phase when everything \\nbecomes a remainder and a residual. Inversely, the disappearance of the fatidic and \\nstructural slash that isolated the rest of ??? and that now permits each term to be the \\nremainder of the other term characterizes a phase of reversibility during which there is \\n\"virtually\" no more remainder. The two propositions are simultaneously \"true\" and are \\nnot mutually exclusive. They are themselves reversible. \\n\\nAnother aspect as surprising as the absence of an opposing term: the remainder makes \\nyou laugh. Any discussion on this theme unleashes the same language games, the same \\nambiguity, and the same obscenity as do discussions of sex or death. Sex and death are \\nthe great themes recognized for unleashing ambivalence and laughter. But the remainder \\nis the third, and perhaps the only one, the two others amounting to this as to the very \\nfigure of reversibility. For why does one laugh? One only laughs at the reversibility of \\nthings, and sex and death are eminently reversible figures. It is because the stake is \\nalways reversible between masculine and feminine, between life and death, that one \\nlaughs at sex and death. How much more, then, at the remainder, which does not even \\nhave an opposing term, which by itself traverses the whole cycle, and runs infinitely after \\nits own slash, after its own double, like Peter Schlemihl after his shadow?*l The \\nremainder is obscene, because it is reversible and is exchanged for itself. It is obscene \\nand makes one laugh, as only the lack of distinction between masculine and feminine, the \\nlack of distinction between life and death makes one laugh, deeply laugh. \\n\\nToday, the remainder has become the weighty term. It is on the remainder that a new \\nintelligibility is founded. End of a certain logic of distinctive oppositions, in which the \\nweak term played the role of the residual term. Today, everything is inverted. \\nPsychoanalysis itself is the first great theorization of residues (lapses, dreams, etc.). It is \\nno longer a political economy of production that directs us, but an economic politics of \\nreproduction, of recycling-ecology and pollution-a political economy of the remainder. \\nAll normality sees itself today in the light of madness, which was nothing but its \\ninsignificant remainder. Privilege of all the remainders, in all domains, of the not - said, \\nthe feminine, the crazy, the marginal, of excrement and waste in art, etc. But this is still \\nnothing but a sort of inversion of the structure, of the return of the repressed as a \\npowerful moment, of the return of the remainder as surplus of meaning, as excess (but \\n\\n\\n\\nexcess is not formally different from the remainder, and the problem of the squandering \\nof excess in Bataille is not different from that of the reabsorption of remainders in a \\npolitical economy of calculation and penury, only the philosophies are different), of a \\nhigher order of meaning starting with the remainder. The secret of all the \"liberations\" \\nthat play on the hidden energies on the other side of the slash. \\n\\nNow we are faced with a much more original situation: not that of the pure and simple \\ninversion and promotion of remainders, but that of an instability in every structure and \\nevery opposition that makes it so that there is no longer even a remainder, due to the fact \\nthat the remainder is everywhere, and by playing with the slash, it annuls itself as such. \\n\\nIt is not when one has taken everything away that nothing is left, rather, nothing is left \\nwhen things are unceasingly shifted and addition itself no longer has any meaning. \\n\\nBirth is residual if it is not symbolically revisited through initiation. \\n\\nDeath is residual if it is not resolved in mourning, in the collective celebration of \\nmourning. \\n\\nValue is residual if it is not reabsorbed and volitalized in the cycle of exchanges. \\n\\nSexuality is residual once it becomes the production of sexual relations. \\n\\nThe social itself is residual once it becomes a production of \"social relations.\" \\n\\nAll of the real is residual, and everything that is residual is destined to repeat itself \\nindefinitely in phantasms. \\n\\nAll accumulation is nothing but a remainder, and the accumulation of remainders, in the \\nsense that it is a rupture of alliance, and in the linear infinity of accumulation and \\ncalculation, in the linear infinity of production, compensates for the energy and value that \\nused to be accomplished in the cycle of alliance. Now, what traverses a cycle is \\ncompletely realized, whereas in the dimension of the infinite, everything that is below the \\nline of the infinite, below the line of eternity (this stockpile of time that itself is also, as \\nwith any stockpile, a rupture of alliances), all of that is nothing but the remainder. \\n\\nAccumulation is nothing but the remainder, and repression is nothing but its inverse and \\nasymmetrical form. It is on the stockpile of repressed affects and representations that our \\nnew alliance is based. \\n\\nBut when everything is repressed, nothing is anymore. We are not far from this absolute \\npoint of repression where the stockpiles are themselves undone, where the stockpiles of \\nphantasms collapse. The whole imaginary of the stockpile, of energy, and of what \\nremains of it, comes to us from repression. When repression reaches a point of critical \\nsaturation where its presence is put in question, then energy will no longer be available to \\nbe liberated, spent, economized, produced: it is the concept of energy itself that will be \\nvolatilized of its own accord. \\n\\n\\n\\nToday the remainder, the energies left us, the restitution and the conservation of \\nremainders, is the crucial problem of humanity. It is insoluble in and of itself. All new \\nfreed or spent energy will leave a new remainder. All desire, all libidinal energy, will \\nproduce a new repression. What is surprising in this, given that energy itself is not \\nconceived except in the movement that stockpiles and liberates it, that represses it and \\n\"produces\" it, that is to say in the figure of the remainder and its double? \\n\\nOne must push at the insane consumption of energy in order to exterminate its concept. \\nOne must push at maximal repression in order to exterminate its concept. Once the last \\nliter of energy has been consumed (by the last ecologist), once the last indigenous person \\nhas been analyzed (by the last ethnologist), once the ultimate commodity has been \\nproduced by the last \"work force,\" then one will realize that this gigantic spiral of energy \\nand production, of repression and the unconscious, thanks to which one has managed to \\nenclose everything in an entropic and catastrophic equation, that all this is in effect \\nnothing but a metaphysics of the remainder, and it will suddenly be resolved in all its \\neffects. \\n\\n* NOTE * \\n\\n1. The allusion to Peter Schlemihl, the Man Who Lost His Shadow, is not accidental. \\nSince the shadow, like the image in the mirror (in The Student from Prague), is a \\nremainder par excellence, something that can \"fall\" from the body, just like hair, \\nexcrement, or nail clippings to which it \"is\" compared in all archaic magic. But they are \\nalso, one knows, \"metaphors\" of the soul, of breath, of Being, of essence, of what \\nprofoundly gives meaning to the subject. Without an image or without a shadow, the \\nbody becomes a transparent nothing, it is itself nothing but a remainder. It is the \\ndiaphanous substance that remains once the shadow is gone. There is no more reality: it \\nis the shadow that has carried all reality away with it (thus in The Student from Prague, \\nthe image broken by the mirror brings with it the immediate death of the hero - classic \\nsequence of fantastic tales - see also The Shadow by Hans Christian Andersen). Thus the \\nbody can be nothing but the waste product of its own residue, the fallout of its own \\nfallout. Only the order said to be real permits privileging the body as reference. But \\nnothing in the symbolic order permits betting on the primacy of one or the other (of the \\nbody or the shadow). And it is this reversion of the shadow onto the body, this fallout of \\nthe essential, by the terms of the essential, under the rubric of the insignificant, this \\nincessant defeat of meaning before what remains of it, be they nail clippings or the \"objet \\npetit a,\" that creates the charm, the beauty, and the disquieting strangeness of these \\nstories. \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SPIRALING CADAVER \\n\\n\\nThe university is in ruins: nonfunctional in the social arenas of the market and \\nemployment, lacking cultural substance or an end purpose of knowledge. \\n\\nStrictly speaking, there is no longer even any power: it is also in ruins. Whence the \\nimpossibility of the return of the fires of 1968: of the return of putting in question \\nknowledge versus power itself - the explosive contradiction of knowledge and power (or \\nthe revelation of their collusion, which comes to the same thing) in the university, and, at \\nthe same time, through symbolic (rather than political) contagion in the whole \\ninstitutional and social order. Why sociologists? marked this shift: the impasse of \\nknowledge, the vertigo of nonknowledge (that is to say at once the absurdity and the \\nimpossibility of accumulating value in the order of knowledge) turns like an absolute \\nweapon against power itself, in order to dismantle it according to the same vertiginous \\nscenario of dispossession. This is the May 1968 effect. Today it cannot be achieved since \\npower itself, after knowledge, has taken off, has become ungraspable - has dispossessed \\nitself. In a now uncertain institution, without knowledge content, without a power \\nstructure (except for an archaic feudalism that turns a simulacrum of a machine whose \\ndestiny escapes it and whose survival is as artificial as that of barracks and theaters), \\noffensive irruption is impossible. Only what precipitates rotting, by accentuating the \\nparodic, simulacral side of dying games of knowledge and power, has meaning. \\n\\nA strike has exactly the opposite effect. It regenerates the ideal of a possible university: \\nthe fiction of an ascension on everyone\\'s part to a culture that is unlocatable, and that no \\nlonger has meaning. This ideal is substituted for the operation of the university as its \\ncritical alternative, as its therapy. This fiction still dreams of a permanency and \\ndemocracy of knowledge. Besides, everywhere today the Left plays this role: it is the \\njustice of the Left that reinjects an idea of justice, the necessity of logic and social morals \\ninto a rotten apparatus that is coming undone, which is losing all conscience of its \\nlegitimacy and renounces functioning almost of its own volition. It is the Left that secrets \\nand desperately reproduces power, because it wants power, and therefore the Left \\nbelieves in it and revives it precisely where the system puts an end to it. The system puts \\nan end one by one to all its axioms, to all its institutions, and realizes one by one all the \\nobjectives of the historical and revolutionary Left that sees itself constrained to revive the \\nwheels of capital in order to lay seige to them one day: from private property to the small \\nbusiness, from the army to national grandeur, from puritan morality to petit bourgeois \\nculture, justice at the university - everything that is disappearing, that the system itself, in \\nits atrocity, certainly, but also in its irreversible impulse, has liquidated, must be \\nconserved. \\n\\nWhence the paradoxical but necessary inversion of all the terms of political analysis. \\n\\nPower (or what takes its place) no longer believes in the university. It knows \\nfundamentally that it is only a zone for the shelter and surveillance of a whole class of a \\ncertain age, it therefore has only to select - it will find its elite elsewhere, or by other \\nmeans. Diplomas are worthless: why would it refuse to award them, in any case it is \\nready to award them to everybody; why this provocative politics, if not in order to \\n\\n\\ncrystallize energies on a fictive stake (selection, work, diplomas, etc.), on an already dead \\nand rotting referential? \\n\\n\\nBy rotting, the university can still do a lot of damage (rotting is a symbolic mechanism - \\nnot political but symbolic, therefore subversive for us). But for this to be the case it is \\nnecessary to start with this very rotting, and not to dream of resurrection. It is necessary \\nto transform this rotting into a violent process, into violent death, through mockery and \\ndefiance, through a multiplied simulation that would offer the ritual of the death of the \\nuniversity as a model of decomposition to the whole of society, a contagious model of the \\ndisaffection of a whole social structure, where death would finally make its ravages, \\nwhich the strike tries desperately to avert, in complicity with the system, but succeeds, on \\ntop of it all, only in transforming the university into a slow death, a delay that is not even \\nthe possible site of a subversion, of an offensive reversion. \\n\\nThat is what the events of May 1968 produced. At a less advanced point in the process of \\nthe liquefaction of the university and of culture, the students, far from wishing to save the \\nfurniture (revive the lost object, in an ideal mode), retorted by confronting power with the \\nchallenge of the total, immediate death of the institution, the challenge of a \\ndeterritorialization even more intense than the one that came from the system, and by \\nsummoning power to respond to this total derailment of the institution of knowledge, to \\nthis total lack of a need to gather in a given place, this death desired in the end - not the \\ncrisis of the university, that is not a challenge, on the contrary, it is the game of the \\nsystem, but the death of the university - to that challenge, power has not been able to \\nrespond, except by its own dissolution in return (only for a moment maybe, but we saw \\nit). \\n\\nThe barricades of 10 May seemed defensive and to be defending a territory: the Latin \\nQuarter, old boutique. But this is not true: behind this facade, it was the dead university, \\nthe dead culture whose challenge they were launching at power, and their own eventual \\ndeath at the same time - a transformation into immediate sacrifice, which was only the \\nlong-term operation of the system itself: the liquidation of culture and of knowledge. \\n\\nThey were not there to save the Sorbonne, but to brandish its cadaver in the face of the \\nothers, just as black people in Watts and in Detroit brandished the ruins of their \\nneighborhoods to which they had themselves set fire. \\n\\nWhat can one brandish today? No longer even the ruins of knowledge, of culture - the \\nruins themselves are defunct. We know it, we have mourned Nanterre for seven years. \\n1968 is dead, repeatable only as a phantasm of mourning. What would be the equivalent \\nin symbolic violence (that is to say beyond the political) would be the same operation \\nthat caused nonknowledge, the rotting of knowledge to come up against power - no \\nlonger discovering this fabulous energy on the same level at all, but on the superior \\nspiral: causing nonpower, the rotting of power to come up against - against what \\nprecisely? There lies the problem. It is perhaps insoluble. Power is being lost, power has \\nbeen lost. All around us there are nothing but dummies of power, but the mechanical \\nillusion of power still rules the social order, behind which grows the absent, illegible, \\nterror of control, the terror of a definitive code, of which we are the minuscule terminals. \\nAttacking representation no longer has much meaning either. One senses quite clearly, \\nfor the same reason, that all student conflicts (as is the case, more broadly, on the level of \\n\\n\\n\\nglobal society) around the representation, the delegation of power are no longer anything \\nbut phantom vicissitudes that yet still manage, out of despair, to occupy the forefront of \\nthe stage. Through I don\\'t know what Mobius effect, representation itself has also turned \\nin on itself, and the whole logical universe of the political is dissolved at the same time, \\nceding its place to a transfinite universe of simulation, where from the beginning no one \\nis represented nor representative of anything any more, where all that is accumulated is \\ndeaccumulated at the same time, where even the axiological, directive, and salvageable \\nphantasm of power has disappeared. A universe that is still incomprehensible, \\nunrecognizable, to us, a universe with a malefic curve that our mental coordinates, which \\nare orthogonal and prepared for the infinite linearity of criticism and history, violently \\nresist. Yet it is there that one must fight, if even fighting has any meaning anymore. We \\nare simulators, we are simulacra (not in the classical sense of \"appearance\"), we are \\nconcave mirrors radiated by the social, a radiation without a light source, power without \\norigin, without distance, and it is in this tactical universe of the simulacrum that one will \\nneed to fight - without hope, hope is a weak value, but in defiance and fascination. \\nBecause one must not refuse the intense fascination that emanates from this liquefaction \\nof all power, of all axes of value, of all axiology, politics included. This spectacle, which \\nis at once that of the death throes and the apogee of capital, surpasses by far that of the \\ncommodity described by the situationists. This spectacle is our essential force. We are no \\nlonger in a relation toward capital of uncertain or victorious forces, but in a political one, \\nthat is the phantasm of revolution. We are in a relation of defiance, of seduction, and of \\ndeath toward this universe that is no longer one, precisely because all axiality that \\nescapes it. The challenge capital directs at us in its delirium - liquidating without shame \\nthe law of profit, surplus value, productive finalities, structures of power, and finding at \\nthe end of its process the profound immorality (but also the seduction) of primitive rituals \\nof destruction, this very challenge must be raised to an insanely higher level. Capital, like \\nvalue, is irresponsible, irreversible, ineluctable. Only to value is capital capable of \\noffering a fantastic spectacle of its decomposition - only the phantom of value still floats \\nover the desert of the classical structures of capital, just as the phantom of religion floats \\nover a world now long desacralized, just as the phantom of knowledge floats over the \\nuniversity. It is up to us to again become the nomads of this desert, but disengaged from \\nthe mechanical illusion of value. We will live in this world, which for us has all the \\ndisquieting strangeness of the desert and of the simulacrum, with all the veracity of living \\nphantoms, of wandering and simulating animals that capital, that the death of capital has \\nmade of us - because the desert of cities is equal to the desert of sand - the jungle of signs \\nis equal to that of the forests - the vertigo of simulacra is equal to that of nature - only the \\nvertiginous seduction of a dying system remains, in which work buries work, in which \\nvalue buries value - leaving a virgin, sacred space without pathways, continuous as \\nBataille wished it, where only the wind lifts the sand, where only the wind watches over \\nthe sand. \\n\\nWhat can one make of all this in the political order? Very little. \\n\\nBut we also have to fight against the profound fascination exerted on us by the death \\nthroes of capital, against the staging by capital of its own death, when we are really the \\nones in our final hours. To leave it the initiative of its own death, is to leave it all the \\nprivileges of revolution. Surrounded by the simulacrum of value and by the phantom of \\ncapital and of power, we are much more disarmed and impotent than when surrounded by \\n\\n\\n\\nthe law of value and of the commodity, since the system has revealed itself capable of \\nintegrating its own death and since we are relieved of the responsibility for this death, \\nand thus of the stake of our own life. This supreme ruse of the system, that of the \\nsimulacrum of its death, through which it maintains us in life by having liquidated \\nthrough absorption all possible negativity, only a superior ruse can stop. Challenge or \\nimaginary science, only a pataphysics of simulacra can can remove us from the system\\' \\nstrategy of simulation and the impasse of death in which it imprisons us. \\n\\n\\n\\nVALUE\\'S LAST TANGO \\n\\n\\nWhere nothing is in its place, lies disorder \\nWhere in the desired place there is nothing, lies order \\n\\n-Brecht \\n\\nPanic on the part of university administrators at the idea that diplomas will be awarded \\nwithout a \"real\"-work counterpart, without an equivalence in knowledge. This panic is \\nnot that of political subversion, it is that of seeing value become dissociated from its \\ncontents and begin to function alone, according to its very form. The values of the \\nuniversity (diplomas, etc.) will proliferate and continue to circulate, a bit like floating \\ncapital or Eurodollars, they will spiral without referential criteria, completely devalorized \\nin the end, but that is unimportant: their circulation alone is enough to create a social \\nhorizon of value, and the ghostly presence of the phantom value will only be greater, \\neven when its reference point (its use value, its exchange value, the academic \"work \\nforce\" that the university recoops) is lost. Terror of value without equivalence. \\n\\nThis situation only appears to be new. It is so for those who still think that a real process \\nof work takes place in the university, and who invest their lived experience, their \\nneuroses, their raison d\\'etre in it. The exchange of signs (of knowledge, of culture) in the \\nuniversity, between \"teachers\" and \"taught\" has for some time been nothing but a doubled \\ncollusion of bitterness and indifference (the indifference of signs that brings with it the \\ndisaffection of social and human relations), a doubled simulacrum of a psychodrama (that \\nof a demand hot with shame, presence, oedipal exchange, with pedagogical incest that \\nstrives to substitute itself for the lost exchange of work and knowledge). In this sense the \\nuniversity remains the site of a desperate initiation to the empty form of value, and those \\nwho have lived there for the past few years are familiar with this strange work, the true \\ndesperation of nonwork, of nonknowledge. Because current generations still dream of \\nreading, of learning, of competing, but their heart isn\\'t in it - as a whole, the ascetic \\ncultural mentality has run body and possessions together. This is why the strike no longer \\nmeans anything.*1 \\n\\nIt is also why we were trapped, we trapped ourselves, after 1968, into giving diplomas to \\neverybody. Subversion? Not at all. Once again, we were the promoters of the advanced \\nform, of the pure form of value: diplomas without work. The system does not want any \\nmore diplomas, but it wants that - operational values in the void - and we were the ones \\nwho inaugurated it, with the illusion of doing the opposite. \\n\\nThe students\\' distress at having diplomas conferred on them for no work complements \\nand is equal to that of the teachers. It is more secret and more insidious than the \\ntraditional anguish of failure or of receiving worthless diplomas. No-risk insurance on the \\ndiploma - which empties the vicissitudes of knowledge and selection of content - is hard \\nto bear. Also it must be complicated by either a benefit - alibi, a simulacrum of work \\nexchanged against a simulacrum of a diploma, or by a form of aggression (the teacher \\ncalled on to give the course, or treated as the automatic distributor) or by rancor, so that \\nat least something will still take place that resembles a \"real\" relation. But nothing works. \\nEven the domestic squabbles between teachers and students, which today make up a great \\n\\n\\npart of their exchanges, are nothing but the recollection of, and a kind of nostalgia for a \\nviolence or a complicity that heretofore made them enemies or united them around a \\nstake of knowledge or a political stake. \\n\\nThe \"hard law of value,\" the \"law set in stone\" - when it abandons us, what sadness, what \\npanic! This is why there are still good days left to fascist and authoritarian methods, \\nbecause they revive something of the violence necessary to life - whether suffered or \\ninflicted. The violence of ritual, the violence of work, the violence of knowledge, the \\nviolence of blood, the violence of power and of the political is good! It is clear, luminous, \\nthe relations of force, contradictions, exploitation, repression! This is lacking today, and \\nthe need for it makes itself felt. The teacher\\'s reinvestment of his power through \"free \\nspeech,\" the self-management of the group and other modern nonsense - it is still all a \\ngame, for example, in the university (but the entire political sphere is articulated in the \\nsame way). No one is fooled. Simply in order to escape profound disillusionment, to \\nescape the catastrophe brought on by the loss of roles, statutes, responsibilities, and the \\nincredible demagoguery that is deployed through them, it is necessary to recreate the \\nprofessor either as a mannequin of power and knowledge, or to invest him with a \\nmodicum of legitimacy derived from the ultra-Left - if not the situation is intolerable for \\neveryone. It is based on this compromise - artificial figuration of the teacher, equivocal \\ncomplicity on the part of the student - it is based on this phantom scenario of pedagogy \\nthat things continue and this time can last indefinitely. Because there is an end to value \\nand to work, there is none to the simulacrum of value and of work. The universe of \\nsimulation is transreal and transfmite: no test of reality will come to put an end to it - \\nexcept the total collapse and slippage of the terrain, which remains our most foolish hope. \\n\\n* Note * \\n\\n1. Moreover, contemporary strikes naturally take on the same qualities as work: the same \\nsuspension, the same weight, the same absence of objectives, the same allergy to \\ndecisions, the same turning round of power, the same mourning of energy, the same \\nundefined circularity in todays strike as in yesterday\\'s work, the same situation in the \\ncounterinstitution as in the institution: the contagion grows, the circle is closed - after that \\nit will be necessary to emerge elsewhere. Or, rather, the opposite: take this impasse itself \\nas the basic situation, turn the indecision and the absence of an objective into an \\noffensive situation, a strategy. In searching at any price to wrench oneself from this \\nmortal situation, from this mental anorexia of the university, the students do nothing but \\nbreathe energy again into an institution long since in a coma; it is forced survival, it is the \\nmedicine of desperation that is practiced today on both institutions and individuals, and \\nthat everywhere is the sign of the same incapacity to confront death. \"One must push \\nwhat is collapsing,\" said Nietzsche. \\n\\n\\n\\nON NIHILISM \\n\\n\\nNihilism no longer wears the dark, Wagnerian, Spenglerian, fuliginous colors of the end \\nof the century. It no longer comes from a Weltanschauung of decadence nor from a \\nmetaphysical radicality bom of the death of God and of all the consequences that must be \\ntaken from this death. Today\\'s nihilism is one of transparency, and it is in some sense \\nmore radical, more crucial than in its prior and historical forms, because this \\ntransparency, this irresolution is indissolubly that of the system, and that of all the theory \\nthat still pretends to analyze it. When God died, there was still Nietzsche to say so - the \\ngreat nihilist before the Eternal and the cadaver of the Eternal. But before the simulated \\ntransparency of all things, before the simulacrum of the materialist or idealist realization \\nof the world in hyperreality (God is not dead, he has become hyper-real), there is no \\nlonger a theoretical or critical God to recognize his own. \\n\\nThe universe, and all of us, have entered live into simulation, into the malefic, not even \\nmalefic, indifferent, sphere of deterrence: in a bizarre fashion, nihilism has been entirely \\nrealized no longer through destruction, but through simulation and deterrence. From the \\nactive, violent phantasm, from the phantasm of the myth and the stage that it also was, \\nhistorically, it has passed into the transparent, falsely transparent, operation of things. \\nWhat then remains of a possible nihilism in theory? What new scene can unfold, where \\nnothing and death could be replayed as a challenge, as a stake? \\n\\nWe are in a new, and without a doubt insoluble, position in relation to prior forms of \\nnihilism: \\n\\nRomanticism is its first great manifestation: it, along with the Enlightenment\\'s \\nRevolution, corresponds to the destruction of the order of appearances. \\n\\nSurrealism, dada, the absurd, and political nihilism are the second great manifestation, \\nwhich corresponds to the destruction of the order of meaning. \\n\\nThe first is still an aesthetic form of nihilism (dandyism), the second, a political, \\nhistorical, and metaphysical form (terrorism). \\n\\nThese two forms no longer concern us except in part, or not at all. The nihilism of \\ntransparency is no longer either aesthetic or political, no longer borrows from either the \\nextermination of appearances, nor from extinguishing the embers of meaning, nor from \\nthe last nuances of an apocalypse. There is no longer an apocalypse (only aleatory \\nterrorism still tries to reflect it, but it is certainly no longer political, and it only has one \\nmode of manifestation left that is at the same time a mode of disappearance: the media - \\nnow the media are not a stage where something is played, they are a strip, a track, a \\nperforated map of which we are no longer even spectators: receivers). The apocalypse is \\nfinished, today it is the precession of the neutral, of forms of the neutral and of \\nindifference. I will leave it to be considered whether there can be a romanticism, an \\naesthetic of the neutral therein. I don\\'t think so - all that remains, is the fascination for \\ndesertlike and indifferent forms, for the very operation of the system that annihilates us. \\nNow, fascination (in contrast to seduction, which was attached to appearances, and to \\n\\n\\ndialectical reason, which was attached to meaning) is a nihilistic passion par excellence, \\nit is the passion proper to the mode of disappearance. We are fascinated by all forms of \\ndisappearance, of our disappearance. Melancholic and fascinated, such is our general \\nsituation in an era of involuntary transparency. \\n\\nI am a nihilist. \\n\\nI observe, I accept, I assume the immense process of the destruction of appearances (and \\nof the seduction of appearances) in the service of meaning (representation, history, \\ncriticism, etc.) that is the fundamental fact of the nineteenth century. The true revolution \\nof the nineteenth century, of modernity, is the radical destruction of appearances, the \\ndisenchantment of the world and its abandonment to the violence of interpretation and of \\nhistory. \\n\\nI observe, I accept, I assume, I analyze the second revolution, that of the twentieth \\ncentury, that of postmodernity, which is the immense process of the destruction of \\nmeaning, equal to the earlier destruction of appearances. He who strikes with meaning is \\nkilled by meaning. \\n\\nThe dialectic stage, the critical stage is empty. There is no more stage. There is no \\ntherapy of meaning or therapy through meaning: therapy itself is part of the generalized \\nprocess of indifferentiation. \\n\\nThe stage of analysis itself has become uncertain, aleatory: theories float (in fact, \\nnihilism is impossible, because it is still a desperate but determined theory, an imaginary \\nof the end, a Weltanschauung of catastrophe).* 1 \\n\\nAnalysis is itself perhaps the decisive element of the immense process of the freezing \\nover of meaning. The surplus of meaning that theories bring, their competition at the \\nlevel of meaning is completely secondary in relation to their coalition in the glacial and \\nfour-tiered operation of dissection and transparency. One must be conscious that, no \\nmatter how the analysis proceeds, it proceeds toward the freezing over of meaning, it \\nassists in the precession of simulacra and of indifferent forms. The desert grows. \\n\\nImplosion of meaning in the media. Implosion of the social in the masses. Infinite growth \\nof the masses as a function of the acceleration of the system. Energetic impasse. Point of \\ninertia. \\n\\nA destiny of inertia for a saturated world. The phenomena of inertia are accelerating (if \\none can say that). The arrested forms proliferate, and growth is immobilized in \\nexcrescence. Such is also the secret of the hypertelie, of what goes further than its own \\nend. It would be our own mode of destroying finalities: going further, too far in the same \\ndirection - destruction of meaning through simulation, hypersimulation, hypertelie. \\nDenying its own end through hyperfinality (the crustacean, the statues of Easter Island) - \\nis this not also the obscene secret of cancer? Revenge of excrescence on growth, revenge \\nof speed on inertia. \\n\\nThe masses themselves are caught up in a gigantic process of inertia through \\n\\n\\n\\nacceleration. They are this excrescent, devouring, process that annihilates all growth and \\nall surplus meaning. They are this circuit short-circuited by a monstrous finality. \\n\\n\\nIt is this point of inertia and what happens outside this point of inertia that today is \\nfascinating, enthralling (gone, therefore, the discreet charm of the dialectic). If it is \\nnihilistic to privilege this point of inertia and the analysis of this irreversibility of systems \\nup to the point of no return, then I am a nihilist. \\n\\nIf it is nihilistic to be obsessed by the mode of disappearance, and no longer by the mode \\nof production, then I am a nihilist. Disappearance, aphanisis, implosion, Fury of \\nVerschwindens. Transpolitics is the elective sphere of the mode of disappearance (of the \\nreal, of meaning, of the stage, of history, of the social, of the individual). To tell the truth, \\nit is no longer so much a question of nihilism: in disappearance, in the desertlike, \\naleatory, and indifferent form, there is no longer even pathos, the pathetic of nihilism - \\nthat mythical energy that is still the force of nihilism, of radicality, mythic denial, \\ndramatic anticipation. It is no longer even disenchantment, with the seductive and \\nnostalgic, itself enchanted, tonality of disenchantment. It is simply disappearance. \\n\\nThe trace of this radicality of the mode of disappearance is already found in Adorno and \\nBenjamin, parallel to a nostalgic exercise of the dialectic. Because there is a nostalgia of \\nthe dialectic, and without a doubt the most subtle dialectic is nostalgic to begin with. But \\nmore deeply, there is in Benjamin and Adomo another tonality, that of a melancholy \\nattached to the system itself, one that is incurable and beyond any dialectic. It is this \\nmelancholia of systems that today takes the upper hand through the ironically transparent \\nforms that surround us. It is this melancholia that is becoming our fundamental passion. \\n\\nIt is no longer the spleen or the vague yearnings of the fin-de-siecle soul. It is no longer \\nnihilism either, which in some sense aims at normalizing everything through destruction, \\nthe passion of resentment (ressentiment).*2 No, melancholia is the fundamental tonality \\nof functional systems, of current systems of simulation, of programming and information. \\nMelancholia is the inherent quality of the mode of the disappearance of meaning, of the \\nmode of the volatilization of meaning in operational systems. And we are all \\nmelancholic. \\n\\nMelancholia is the brutal disaffection that characterizes our saturated systems. Once the \\nhope of balancing good and evil, true and false, indeed of confronting some values of the \\nsame order, once the more general hope of a relation of forces and a stake has vanished. \\nEverywhere, always, the system is too strong: hegemonic. \\n\\nAgainst this hegemony of the system, one can exalt the ruses of desire, practice \\nrevolutionary micrology of the quotidian, exalt the molecular drift or even defend \\ncooking. This does not resolve the imperious necessity of checking the system in broad \\ndaylight. \\n\\nThis, only terrorism can do. \\n\\nIt is the trait of reversion that effaces the remainder, just as a single ironic smile effaces a \\nwhole discourse, just as a single flash of denial in a slave effaces all the power and \\n\\n\\n\\npleasure of the master. \\n\\n\\nThe more hegemonic the system, the more the imagination is struck by the smallest of its \\nreversals. The challenge, even infinitesimal, is the image of a chain failure. Only this \\nreversibility without a counterpart is an event today, on the nihilistic and disaffected \\nstage of the political. Only it mobilizes the imaginary. \\n\\nIf being a nihilist, is carrying, to the unbearable limit of hegemonic systems, this radical \\ntrait of derision and of violence, this challenge that the system is summoned to answer \\nthrough its own death, then I am a terrorist and nihilist in theory as the others are with \\ntheir weapons. Theoretical violence, not truth, is the only resource left us. \\n\\nBut such a sentiment is Utopian. Because it would be beautiful to be a nihilist, if there \\nwere still a radicality - as it would be nice to be a terrorist, if death, including that of the \\nterrorist, still had meaning. \\n\\nBut it is at this point that things become insoluble. Because to this active nihilism of \\nradicality, the system opposes its own, the nihilism of neutralization. The system is itself \\nalso nihilistic, in the sense that it has the power to pour everything, including what denies \\nit, into indifference. \\n\\nIn this system, death itself shines by virtue of its absence. (The Bologna train station, the \\nOktoberfest in Munich: the dead are annulled by indifference, that is where terrorism is \\nthe involuntary accomplice of the whole system, not politically, but in the accelerated \\nform of indifference that it contributes to imposing.) Death no longer has a stage, neither \\nphantasmatic nor political, on which to represent itself, to play itself out, either a \\nceremonial or a violent one. And this is the victory of the other nihilism, of the other \\nterrorism, that of the system. \\n\\nThere is no longer a stage, not even the minimal illusion that makes events capable of \\nadopting the force of reality-no more stage either of mental or political solidarity: what \\ndo Chile, Biafra, the boat people, Bologna, or Poland matter? All of that comes to be \\nannihilated on the television screen. We are in the era of events without consequences \\n(and of theories without consequences). \\n\\nThere is no more hope for meaning. And without a doubt this is a good thing: meaning is \\nmortal. But that on which it has imposed its ephemeral reign, what it hoped to liquidate in \\norder to impose the reign of the Enlightenment, that is, appearances, they, are immortal, \\ninvulnerable to the nihilism of meaning or of non-meaning itself. \\n\\nThis is where seduction begins. \\n\\n* NOTES * \\n\\n1.

Simulation is no longer that of a \\nterritory, a referential being or a substance. \\nIt is the generation by models of a real \\nwithout origin or reality: a hyperreal. The \\nterritory no longer precedes the map, nor \\nsurvives it. Henceforth, it is the map that \\nprecedes the territory — PRECESSION OF \\nSIMULACRA— it is the map that engenders the \\nterritory and if we were to revive the fable \\ntoday, it would be the territory whose shreds \\nare slowly rotting across the map. It is the \\nreal, and not the map, whose vestiges subsist \\nhere and there, in the deserts which are no \\nlonger those of the Empire, but our own. \\nThe desert of the real itself. \\n\\nIn fact, even inverted, the fable is \\nuseless. Perhaps only the allegory of the \\nEmpire remains. For it is with the same \\nImperialism that present-day simulators try \\nto make the real, all the real, coincide with \\ntheir simulation models. But it is no longer a \\nquestion of either maps or territory. \\nSomething has disappeared: the sovereign \\ndifference between them that was the \\nabstraction\\'s charm For it is the difference \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nwhich forms the poetry of the map and the \\ncharm of the territory, the magic of the \\nconcept and the charm of the real. This \\nrepresentational imaginary, which both \\nculminates in and is engulfed by the \\ncartographer\\'s mad project of an ideal \\ncoextensivity between the map and the \\nterritory, disappears with simulation — \\nwhose operation is nuclear and genetic, and \\nno longer specular and discursive. With it \\ngoes all of metaphysics. No more mirror of \\nbeing and appearances, of the real and its \\nconcept. No more imaginary coextensivity: \\nrather, genetic miniaturisation is the dimen- \\nsion of simulation. The real is produced from \\nminiaturised units, from matrices, memory \\nbanks and command models — and with these \\nit can be reproduced an indefinite number of \\ntimes. It no longer has to be rational, since it \\nis no longer measured against some ideal or \\nnegative instance. It is nothing more than \\noperational. In fact, since it is no longer \\nenveloped by an imaginary, it is no longer \\nreal at all. It is a hyperreal, the product of an \\nirradiating synthesis of combinatory models \\nin a hyperspace without atmosphere. \\n\\nIn this passage to a space whose \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\ncurvature is no longer that of the real, nor of \\ntruth, the age of simulation thus begins with \\na liquidation of all referentials— worse: by \\ntheir artificial resurrection in systems of \\nsigns, a more ductile material than meaning, \\nin that it lends itself to all systems of \\nequivalence, all binary oppositions and alt \\ncombinatory algebra. It is no longer a \\nquestion of imitation, nor of reduplication, \\nnor even of parody. It is rather a question of \\nsubstituting signs of the real for the real \\nitself, that is, an operation todeter every real \\nprocess by its operational double, a metast- \\nable, programmatic, perfect descriptive ma- \\nchine which provides all the signs of the real \\nand short-circuits all its vicissitudes. Never \\nagain will the real have to be produced — this \\nis the vital function of the model in a system \\nof death, or rather of anticipated resur- \\nrection which no longer leaves any chance \\neven in the event of death. A hyperreal \\nhenceforth sheltered from the imaginary, \\nand from any distinction between the real \\nand the imaginary, leaving room only for the \\norbital recurrence of models and the \\nsimulated generation of difference. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Divine Irreference of Images \\n\\nTo dissimulate is to feign not to have \\nwhat one has. To simulate is to feign to have \\nwhat one hasn\\'t. One implies a presence, the \\nother an absence. But the matter is more \\ncomplicated, since to simulate is not simply \\nto feign: \"Someone who feigns an illness can \\nsimply go to bed and make believe he is ill. \\nSome who simulates an illness produces in \\nhimself some of the symptoms.\" (Littre) \\nThus, feigning or dissimulating leaves the \\nreality principle intact: the difference is \\nalways clear, it is only masked; whereas \\nsimulation threatens the difference between \\n\"true\" and \"false\", between \"real\" and \\n\"imaginary\". Since the simulator produces, \\n\"true\" symptoms, is he ill or not? He cannot \\nbe treated objectively either as ill, or as not- \\nill. Psychology and medicine stop at this \\npoint, before a thereafter undiscoverable \\ntruth of the illness. For if any symptom can \\nbe \"produced\", and can no longer be accepted \\nas a fact of nature, then every illness may be \\nconsidered as simulatable and simulated, and \\nmedicine loses its meaning since it only \\nknows how to treat \"true\" illnesses by their \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nobjective causes. Psychosomatics evolves in a \\ndubious way on the edge of the illness \\nprinciple. As for psychoanalysis, it transfers \\nthe symptom from the organic to the \\nunconscious order: once again, the latter is \\nheld to be true, more true than the former — \\nbut why should simulation stop at the portals \\nof the unconscious? Why couldn\\'t the \\n\"work\" of the unconscious be \"produced\" in \\nthe same way as any other symptom in \\nclassical medicine? Dreams already are. \\n\\nThe alienist, of course, claims that \"for \\neach form of the mental alienation there is a \\nparticular order in the succession of symp- \\ntoms, of which the simulator is unaware and \\nin the absence of which the alienist is \\nunlikely to be deceived.\" This (which dates \\nfrom 1865) in order to save at all cost the \\ntruth principle, and to escape the spectre \\nraised by simulation — namely that truth, \\nreference and objective causes have ceased to \\nexist. What can medicine do with something \\nwhich floats on either side of illness, on \\neither side of health, or with the reduplica- \\ntion of illness in a discourse that is no longer \\ntrue or false? What can psychoanalysis do \\nwith the reduplication of the discourse of the \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nunconscious in a discourse of simulation that \\ncan never be unmasked, since it isn\\'t false \\neither? J \\n\\nWhat can the army do with simulators? \\nTraditionally, following a direct principle of \\nidentification, it unmasks and punishes \\nthem. Today, it can reform an excellent \\nsimulator as though he were equivalent to a \\n\"real\" homosexual, heart-case or lunatic. \\nEven military psychology retreats from the \\nCartesian clarities and hesitates to draw the \\ndistinction between true and false, between \\nthe \"produced\" symptom and the authentic \\nsymptom. \"If he acts crazy so well, then he \\nmust be mad.\" Nor is it mistaken: in the sense \\nthat all lunatics are simulators, and this lack \\nof distinction is the worst form of subver- \\nsion. Against it classical reason armed itself \\nwith all its categories. But it is this today \\nwhich again outflanks them, submerging the \\ntruth principle. \\n\\nOutside of medicine and the army, \\nfavored terrains of simulation, the affair \\ngoes back to religion and the simulacrum of \\ndivinity: \"I forbad any simulacrum in the \\ntemples because the divinity that breathes \\nlife into nature cannot be represented.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nIndeed it can. But what becomes of the \\ndivinity when it reveals itself in icons, when \\nit is multiplied in simulacra? Does it remain \\nthe supreme authority, simply incarnated in \\nimages as a visible theology? Or is it \\nvolatilized into simulacra which alone deploy \\ntheir pomp and power of fascination — the \\nvisible machinery of icons being substituted \\nfor the pure and intelligible Idea of God? This \\nis precisely what was feared by the \\nIconoclasts, whose millenial quarrel is still \\nwith us today. 3 Their rage to destroy \\nimages rose precisely because they sensed \\nthis omnipotence of simulacra, this facility \\nthey have of effacing God from the \\nconsciousness of men, and the overwhelm- \\ning, destructive truth which they suggest: \\nthat ultimately there has never been any God, \\nthat only the simulacrum exists, indeed that \\nGod himself has only ever been his own \\nsimulacrum. Had they been able to believe \\nthat images only occulted or masked the \\nPlatonic Idea of God, there would have been \\nno reason to destroy them. One can live with \\nthe idea of a distorted truth. But their \\nmetaphysical despair came from the idea that \\nthe images concealed nothing at all, and that \\n\\n\\n\\n8 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nin fact they were not images, such as the \\noriginal model would have made them, but \\nactually perfect simulacra forever radiant \\nwith their own fascination. But this death of \\nthe divine referential has to be exorcised at \\nall cost. \\n\\nIt can be seen that the iconoclasts, who \\nare often accused of despising and denying \\nimages, were in fact the ones who accorded \\nthem their actual worth, unlike the iconolaters, \\nwho saw in them only reflections and were \\ncontent to venerate God at one remove. But the \\nconverse can also be said, namely that the \\niconolaters were the most modern and \\nadventurous minds, since underneath the idea \\nof the apparition of God in the mirror of images, \\nthey already enacted his death and his \\ndisappearance in the epiphany of his represent- \\nations (which they perhaps knew no longer \\nrepresented anything, and that they were \\npurely a game, but that this was precisely the \\ngreatest game— knowing also that it is \\ndangerous to unmask images, since they \\ndissimulate the fact that there is nothing behind \\nthem). \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nThis was the approach of the Jesuits, \\nwho based their politics on the virtual \\ndisappearance of God and on the worldly and \\nspectacular manipulation of consciences — \\nthe evanescence of God in the epiphany of \\npower— the end of transcendence, which no \\nlonger serves as alibi for a strategy \\ncompletely free of influences and signs. \\nBehind the baroque of images hides the grey \\neminence of politics. \\n\\nThus perhaps at stake has always been \\nthe murderous capacity of images, muderers \\nof the real, murderers of their own model as \\nthe Byzantine icons could murder the divine \\nidentity. To this murderous capacity is \\nopposed the dialectical capacity of represent- \\nations as a visible and intelligible mediation \\nof the Real. All of Western faith and good \\nfaith was engaged in this wager on \\nrepresentation: that a sign could refer to the \\ndepth of meaning, that a sign could exchange \\nfor meaning and that something could \\nguarantee this exchange — God, of course. \\nBut what if God himself can be simulated, \\nthat is to say, reduced to the signs which \\nattest his existence? Then the whole system \\nbecomes weightless, it is no longer anything \\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nbut a gigantic simulacrum — not unreal, but a \\nsimulacrum, never again exchanging for \\nwhat is real, but exchanging in itself, in an \\nuninterrupted circuit without reference or \\ncircumference. \\n\\nSo it is with simulation, insofar as it is \\nopposed to representation. The latter starts \\nfrom the principle that the sign and the real \\nare equivalent (even if this equivalence is \\nUtopian, it is a fundamental axiom). Con- \\nversely, simulation starts from the utopia of \\nthis principle of equivalence, from the radical \\nnegation of the sign as value, from the sign as \\nreversion and death sentence of every \\nreference. Whereas representation tries to \\nabsorb simulation by interpreting it as false \\nrepresentation, simulation envelops the \\nwhole edifice of representation as itself a \\nsimulacrum. \\n\\nThis would be the successive phases of \\nthe image-. \\n\\n—it is the reflection of a basic reality \\n— it masks and perverts a basic reality \\n— it masks the absence of a basic reality \\n— it bears no relation to any reality \\nwhatever it is its own pure simulacrum. \\nIn the first case, the image is a good \\n\\n\\n\\n11 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nappearance — the representation is of the \\norder of sacrament. In the second, it is an evil \\nappearance — of the order of malefice. In the \\nthird, it plays at being an appearance — it is of \\nthe order of sorcery. In the fourth, it is no \\nlonger in the order of appearance at all, but of \\nsimulation. \\n\\nThe transition from signs which dis- \\nsimulate something to signs which dissimu- \\nlate that there is nothing, marks the decisive \\nturning point. The first implies a theology of \\ntruth and secrecy (to which the notion of \\nideology still belongs). The second inaugura- \\ntes an age of simulacra and stimulation, in \\nwhich there is no longer any God to \\nrecognise his own, nor any last judgement to \\nseparate true from false, the real from its \\nartificial resurrection, since everything is \\nalready dead and risen in advance. \\n\\nWhen the real is no longer what it used \\nto be, nostalgia assumes its full meaning. \\nThere is a proliferation of myths of origin \\nand signs of reality; of second-hand truth, \\nobjectivity and authenticity. There is an \\nescalation of the true, of the lived experience; \\na resurrection of the figurative where the \\nobject and substance have disappeared. And \\n\\n\\n\\n12 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nthere is a panic-stricken production of the \\nreal and the referential, above and parallel to \\nthe panic of material production: this is how \\nsimulation appears in the phase that \\nconcerns us — a strategy of the real, neo-real \\nand hypperral whose universal double is a \\nstrategy of deterrence. \\n\\n\\n\\nRameses, or Rose-Coloured Resurrection \\nEthnology almost met a paradoxical \\ndeath that day in 1971 when the Phillipino \\ngovernment decided to return the few dozen \\nTasaday discovered deep in the jungle, where \\nthey had lived for eight centuries undisturb- \\ned by the rest of mankind, to their primitive \\nstate, out of reach of colonists, tourists and \\nethnologists. This was at the initiative of the \\nanthropologists themselves, who saw the \\nnatives decompose immediately on contact, \\nlike a mummy in the open air. \\n\\nFor ethnology to live, its object must die. \\nBut the latter revenges itself by dying for \\nhaving been \"discovered\", and defies by its \\ndeath the science that wants to take hold of \\nit. \\n\\nDoesn\\'t every science live on this \\n\\n\\n\\n13 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nparadoxical slope to which it is doomed by \\nthe evanescence of its object in the very \\nprocess of its apprehension, and by the \\npitiless reversal this dead object exerts on it? \\nLike Orpheus it always turns around too \\nsoon, and its object, like Eurydice, falls back \\ninto Hades. \\n\\nIt was against this hades of paradox that \\nthe ethnologists wanted to protect them- \\nselves by cordoning off the Tasaday with \\nvirgin forest. Nobody now will touch it: the \\nvein is closed down, like a mine. Science loses \\na precious capital, but the object will be \\nsafe — lost to science, but intact in its \\n\"virginity\". It isn\\'t a question of sacrifice \\n(science never sacrifices itself: it is always \\nmurderous), but of the simulated sacrifice of \\nits object in order to save its reality principle. \\nThe Tasaday, frozen in their natural \\nelement, provide a perfect alibi, an eternal \\nguarantee. At this point begins a persistent \\nanti-ethnology to which Jaulin, Castaneda \\nand Clastres variously belong. In any case, \\nthe logical evolution of a science is todistance \\nitself ever further from its object until it \\ndispenses with it entirely: its autonomy \\nevermore fantastical in reaching its pure \\n\\n\\n\\n14 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nform. \\n\\nThe Indian thereby driven back into the \\nghetto, into the glass coffin of virgin forest, \\nbecomes the simulation model for all \\nconceivable Indians before ethwhgu. The latter \\nthus allows itself the luxury of being \\nincarnate beyond itself, in the\"brute\" reality \\nof these Indians it has entirely reinvented — \\nSavages who are indebted to ethnology for \\nstill being Savages: what a turn of events, \\nwhat a triumph for this science which \\nseemed dedicated to their destruction! \\n\\nOf course, these particular Savages are \\nposthumous: frozen, cryogenised, sterilised, \\nprotected to death, they have become referen- \\ntial simulacra, and the science itself a pure \\nsimulation. Same thing at Creusot where, in \\nthe form of an \"open\" museum exhibition, \\nthey have \"museumised\" on the spot, as \\nhistorical witnesses to their period, entire \\nworking class quartiers, living metallurgical \\nzones, a complete culture including men, \\nwomen and children and their gestures, \\nlanguages and habits — living beings fossil- \\nised as in a snap shot. The museum, instead \\nof being curcumscribed in a geometrical \\nlocation, is now everywhere, like a dimen- \\n\\n\\n\\n15 \\n\\n\\n\\njean Baudriilard \\n\\n\\n\\nsion of life itself. Thus ethnology, now freed \\nfrom its object, will no longer be circum- \\nscribed as an objective science but is applied \\nto all living things and becomes invisible, like \\nan omnipresent fourth dimension, that of \\nthe simulacrum. We are all Tasaday. or Indians \\nwho have once more become \"what they \\nused to be\", or at least that which ethnology \\nhas made them — simulacra Indians who \\nproclaim at last the universal truth of \\nethnology. \\n\\nWe all become living specimens under \\nthe spectral light of ethnology, or of anti- \\nethnology which is only the pure form of \\ntriumphal ethnology, under the sign of dead \\ndifferences, and of the resurrection of \\ndifferences. It is thus extremely naive tolook \\nfor ethnology among the Savages or in some \\nThird World — it is here, everywhere, in the \\nmetropolis, among the whites, in a world \\ncompletely catalogued and analysed and then \\nartificially revived as though real, in a world of \\nsimulation; of the hallucination of truth, of \\nblackmail by the real, of the murder and \\nhistorical (hysterical) retrospection of every \\nsymbolic form— a murder whose first \\n\\n\\n\\n16 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nvictims were, noblesse oblige, the Savages, \\nbut which for a long time now has been \\nextended to all Western societies. \\n\\nBut at the same moment ethnology \\ngives up its final and only lesson, the secret \\nwhich kills it (and which the savages \\nunderstood much better): the vengeance of \\nthe dead. \\n\\nThe confinement of the scientific object \\nis the same as that of theinsaneand thedead. \\nAnd just as the whole of society is hopelessly \\ncontaminated by that mirror of madness it \\nhas held out for itself, so science can only die \\ncontaminated by the death of the object \\nwhich is its inverse mirror. It is science which \\nostensibly masters the object, but it is the \\nlatter which deeply invests the former, \\nfollowing an unconscious reversion, giving \\nonly dead and circular replies to a dead and \\ncircular interrogation. \\n\\nNothing changes when society breaks \\nthe mirror of madness (abolishes asylums, \\ngives speech back to the mad, etc.) nor when \\nscience seems to break the mirror of its \\nobjectivity (effacing itself before its object, as \\nCastaneda does, etc.) and to bow down \\nbefore \"differences\". Confinement is suc- \\n\\n\\n\\n17 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nceeded by an apparatus which assumes a \\ncountless and endlessly diffractabie, multi- \\npliable form. As fast as ethnology in its \\nclassical institution collapses, it survives in \\nan anti-ethnology whose task is to reinject \\nfictional difference and Savagery every- \\nwhere, in order to conceal the fact that it is \\nthis world, our own, which in its way has \\nbecome savage again, that is to say \\ndevastated by difference and death. \\n\\nIt is in this way, under the pretext of \\nsaving the original, that the caves of Lascaux \\nhave been forbidden to visitors and an exact \\nreplica constructed 500 metres away, so that \\neveryone can see them {you glance through a \\npeephole at the real grotto and then visit the \\nreconstituted whole). It is possible that the \\nvery memory of the original caves will fade in \\nthe mind of future generations, but from \\nnow on there is no longer any difference: the \\nduplication is sufficient to render both \\nartificial. \\n\\nIn the same way the whole of science and \\ntechnology were recently mobilised to save \\nthe mummy of Rameses II, after it had been \\nleft to deteriorate in the basement of a \\n\\n\\n\\n18 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nmuseum. The West was panic-stricken at the \\nthought of not being able to save what the \\nsymbolic order had been able to preserve for \\n40 centuries, but away from the light and \\ngaze of onlookers. Rameses means nothing \\nto us: only the mummy is of inestimable \\nworth since it is what guarantees that \\naccumulation means something. Out entire \\nlinear and accumulative culture would \\ncollapse if we could not stockpile the past in \\nplain view. To this end the pharaohs must be \\nbrought out of their tombs, and the \\nmummies out of their silence. To this end \\nthey must be exhumed and given military \\nhonors. They are prey to both science and \\nthe worms. Only absolute secrecy ensured \\ntheir potency throughout the millenia— \\ntheir mastery over putrefaction, which \\nsignified a mastery over the total cycle of \\nexchange with death. We know better than to \\nuse our science for the reparation of the \\nmummy, that is, to restore a visible order, \\nwhereas embalming was a mythical labor \\naimed at immortalising a hidden dimension. \\n\\nWe need a visible past, a visible \\ncontinuum, a visible myth of origin to \\nreassure us as to our ends, since ultimately \\n\\n\\n\\n19 \\n\\n\\n\\njean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nwe have never believed in them. Whence that \\nhistoric scene of the mummy\\'s reception at \\nOrly airport. All because Rameses was a \\ngreat despot and military figure? Certainly: \\nbut above all because the order which our \\nculture dreams of, behind that defunct \\npower it seeks to annex, could have had \\nnothing to do with it, and it dreams thus \\nbecause it has exterminated this order by \\nexhuming it as if it were our own past. \\n\\nWe are fascinated by Rameses as \\nRenaissance Christians were by the Ameri- \\ncan Indians: those (human?) beings who had \\nnever known the word of Christ. Thus, at \\nthe beginning of colonisation, there was a \\nmoment of stupor and amazement before \\nthe very possibility of escaping the universal \\nlaw of the Gospel. There were two possible \\nresponses: either to admit that this law was \\nnot universal, or to exterminate the Indians \\nso as to remove the evidence. In general, it \\nwas enough to convert them, or even simply \\nto discover them, to ensure their slow \\nextermination. \\n\\nThus it would have been enough to \\nexhume Rameses to ensure his extermina- \\n\\n\\n\\n20 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\ntion by museumification. For mummies do \\nnot decay because of worms: they die from \\n\\nbeing transplanted from, a prolonged symbol- \\nic order, which is master over death and \\nputrescence, on to an order of history, \\nscience and museums — our own, which is no \\nlonger master over anything, since it only \\nknows how to condemn its predecessors to \\ndeath and putrescence and their subsequent \\nresuscitation by science. An irreparable \\nviolence towards all secrets, the violence of a \\ncivilisation without secrets. The hatred by an \\nentire civilisation for its own foundations. \\n\\nAnd just as with ethnology playing at \\nsurrendering its object the better toestablish \\nitself in its pure form, so museumification is \\nonly one more turn in the spiral of \\nartificiality. Witness the cloister of St-Michel \\nde Cuxa, which is going to be repatriated at \\ngreat expense from the Cloisters in New \\nYork to be reinstalled on \"its original site\". \\nAnd everyone is supposed to applaud this \\nrestitution (as with the \"experimental \\ncampaign to win back the sidewalks\" on the \\nChamps-Elysees!). However, if the export- \\nation of the cornices was in effect an \\narbitrary act, and if the Cloisters of New \\n\\n\\n\\n21 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nYork are really an artificial mosaic of all \\ncultures (according to a logic of the capitalist \\ncentralisation of value), then reimportation \\nto the original location is even moreartificial: \\nit is a total simulacrum that links up with \\n\"reality\" by a complete circumvolution. \\n\\nThe cloister should have stayed in New \\nYork in its simulated environment, which at \\nleast would have fooled no one- Repatriation \\nis only a supplementary subterfuge, in order \\nto make out as though nothing had happened \\nand to indulge in a retrospective hallucina- \\ntion. \\n\\nIn the same way Americans flatter \\nthemselves they brought the number of \\nIndians back to what it was before their \\nconquest. Everything is obliterated only to \\nbegin again. They even flatter themselves \\nthey went one better, by surpassing the \\noriginal figure. This is presented as proof of \\nthe superiority of civilisation: it produces \\nmore Indians than they were capable of \\nthemselves. By a sinister mockery, this \\noverproduction is yet again a way of \\ndestroying them: for Indian culture, like all \\ntribal culture, rests on the limitation of the \\ngroup and prohibiting any of its\"unrestrict- \\n\\n\\n\\n22 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\ned\" growth, as can be seen in the case of Ishi. \\nDemographic \"promotion\", threfore, is just \\none more step towards symbolic extermina- \\ntion. \\n\\nWe too live in a universe everywhere \\nstrangely similar to the original— here things \\nare duplicated by their own scenario. But this \\ndouble does not mean, as in folklore, the \\nimminence of death — they are already \\npurged of death, and are even better than in \\nlife; more smiling, more authentic, in light of \\ntheir model, like the faces in funeral parlors. \\n\\nHyperreal and Imaginary \\nDisneyland is a perfect model of all the \\nentangled orders of simulation. To begin \\nwith it is a play of illusions and phantasms: \\nPirates, the Frontier, Future World, etc. This \\nimaginary world is supposed to be what \\nmakes the operation successful. But what \\ndraws the crowds is undoubtedly much more \\nthe social microcosm, the miniaturised and \\nreligious revelling in real America, in Us \\ndelights and drawbacks. You park outside, \\nqueue up inside, and are totally abandoned \\nat the exit. In this imaginary world the only \\nphantasmagoria is in the inherent warmth \\n\\n\\n\\n23 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nand affection of the crowd, and in that \\nsufficiently excessive number of gadgets \\nused there to specifically maintain the \\nmultitudinous affect. The contrast with the \\nabsolute solitude of the parking lot— a \\nveritable concentration camp — is total. Or \\nrather: inside, a whole range of gadgets \\nmagnetise the crowd into direct flows — \\noutside, solitude is directed onto a single \\ngadget: the automobile. By an extraordinary \\ncoincidence (one that undoubtedly belongs \\nto the peculiar enchantment of this uni- \\nverse), this deep-frozen infantile world \\nhappens to have been conceived and realised \\nby a man who is himself now cryogenised: \\nWalt Disney, who awaits his resurrection at \\nminus 180 degrees centigrade. \\n\\nThe objective profile of America, then, \\nmay be traced throughout Disneyland, even \\ndown to the morphology of individuals and \\nthe crowd. All its values are exalted here, in \\nminiature and comic strip form. Embalmed \\nand pacified. Whence the possibility of an \\nideological analysis of Disneyland (L. Marin \\ndoes it well in Utopies, ieux d\\'espaces); digest of \\nthe American way of life, panegyric to \\nAmerican values, idealised transposition of a \\n\\n\\n\\n24 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\ncontradictory reality. To be sure. But this \\nconceals something else, and that \"ideologic- \\nal\" blanket exactly serves to cover over a \\nthird-order simulation: Disneyland is there to \\nconceal the fact that it is the \"real\" country, \\nall of \"real\" America, which is Disneyland \\n(just as prisons are there to conceal the fact \\nthat it is the social in its entirety, in its banal \\nomnipresence, which is carceral). Disneyland \\nis presented as imaginary in order to make us \\nbelieve that the rest is real, when in fact all of \\nLos Angeles and the America surrounding it \\nare no longer real, but of the order of the \\nhyperreal and of simulation. It is no longer a \\nquestion of a false representation of reality \\n(ideology), but of concealing the fact that the \\nreal is no longer real, and thus of saving the \\nreality principle. \\n\\nThe Disneyland imaginary is neither \\ntrue nor false; it is a deterrence machine set \\nup in order to rejuvenate in reverse the \\nfiction of the real. Whence the debility, the \\ninfantile degeneration of this imaginary. 1 1 is \\nmeant to be an infantile world, in order to \\nmake us believe that the adults are \\nelsewhere, in the \"real\" world, and to conceal \\nthe fact that real childishness is everywhere, \\n\\n\\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nparticularly amongst those adults who go \\nthere to act the child in order to foster \\nillusions as to their real childishness. \\n\\nMoreover, Disneyland is not the only \\none. Enchanted Village, Magic Mountain, \\nMarine World: Los Angeles is encircled by \\nthese \"imaginary stations\" which feed \\nreality, reality- energy, to a town whose \\nmystery is precisely that it is nothing more \\nthan a network of endless, unreal circula- \\ntion — a town of fabulous proportions, but \\nwithout space or dimensions. As much as \\nelectrical and nuclear power stations, as \\nmuch as film studios, this town, which is \\nnothing more than an immense script and a \\nperpetual motion picture, needs this old \\nimaginary made up of childhood signals and \\nfaked phantasms for its sympathetic nervous \\nsystem. \\n\\nPolitical Incantation \\nWatergate. Same scenario as Disneyland \\n(an imaginary effect concealing that reality \\nno more exists outside than inside the \\nbounds of the artificial perimeter); though \\nhere it is a scandal effect concealing that \\nthere is no difference between the facts and \\n\\n\\n\\n26 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\ntheir denunciation (identical methods are \\nemployed by the CIA and the Washington Post \\njournalists). Same operation, though this \\ntime tending towards scandal as a means to \\nregenerate a moral and political principle, \\ntowards the imaginary as a means to \\nregenerate a reality principle in distress. \\n\\nThe denunciation of scandal always pays \\nhomage to the law. And Watergate above all \\nsucceeded in imposing the idea that Water- \\ngate was a scandal — in this sense it was an \\nextraordinary operation of intoxication. The \\nreinjection of a large dose of political \\nmorality on a global scale. It could be said \\nalong with Bourdieu that: \"The specific \\ncharacter of every relation of force is to \\ndissimulate itself as such, and to acquire all \\nits force only because it is so dissimulated\", \\nunderstood as follows: capital, which is \\nimmoral and unscrupulous, can only func- \\ntion behind a moral superstructure, and \\nwhoever regenerates this public morality (by \\nindignation, denunciation, etc.) spontaneous- \\nly furthers the order of capital, as did the \\nWashington Post journalists. \\n\\nBut this is still only the formula of \\nideology, and when Bourdieu enunciates it. \\n\\n\\n\\n27 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nhe takes \"relation of force\" to mean the truth \\nof capitalist domination, and he denounces this \\nrelation of force as itself a scandal — he \\ntherefore occupies the same deterministic \\nand moralistic position as the Washington Post \\njounalists. He does the same job of purging \\nand reviving moral order, an order of truth \\nwherein the genuine symbolic violence of the \\nsocial order is engendered, well beyond all \\nrelations of force, which are only its \\nindifferent and shifting configuration in the \\nmoral and political consciousness of men. \\n\\nAll that capital asks of us is to receive it \\nas rational or to combat it in the name of \\nrationality, to receive it as moral or tocombat \\nit in the name of morality. For they are \\nidentical, meaning they can be read another way: \\nbefore, the task was to dissimulate scandal; \\ntoday, the task is to conceal the fact that \\nthere is none. \\n\\nWatergate is not a scandal: this is what must \\nbe said at all cost, for this is what everyone is \\nconcerned to conceal this dissimulation \\nmasking a strengthening of morality, a moral \\npanic as we approach the primal (mise en) \\nscene of capital; its instantaneous cruelty, its \\nincomprehensible ferocity, its fundamental \\n\\n\\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nimmorality — this is what is scandalous, \\nunaccountable for in that system of moral \\nand economic equivalence which remains the \\naxiom of leftist thought, from Enlighten- \\nment theory to communism. Capital doesn\\'t \\ngive a damn about the idea of the contract \\nwhich is imputed to it — it is a monstrous \\nunprincipled undertaking, nothing more. \\nRather, it is \"enlightened\" thought which \\nseeks to control capital by imposing rules on \\nit. And all that recrimination which replaced \\nrevolutionary thought today comes down to \\nreproaching capital for not following the \\nrules of the game. \"Power is unjust, its \\njustice is a class justice, capital exploits us, \\netc.\" — as if capital were linked by a contract \\nto the society it rules. It is the left which \\nholds out the mirror of equivalence, hoping \\nthat capital will fall for this phantasmagoria \\nof the social contract and fulfull its \\nobligation towards the whole of society (at \\nthe same time, no need for revolution: it is \\nenough that capital accept the rational \\nformula of exchange). \\n\\nCapital in fact has never beeen linked by \\na contract to the society it dominates. It is a \\nsorcery of the social relation, it is a challenge to \\n\\n\\n\\n29 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nsociety and should be responded toas such. It is \\nnot a scandal to be denounced according to \\nmoral and economic rationality, but a \\nchallenge to take up according to symbolic \\nlaw. \\n\\nMoebius-Spiralli ng Negativity \\nHence Watergate was only a trap set by \\nthe system to catch its adversaries — a \\nsimulation of scandal to regenerative ends. \\nThis is embodied by the character called \\n\"Deep Throat\", who was said to be a \\nRepublican grey eminence manipulating the \\nleftist journalists in order to get rid of \\nNixon — and why not? All hypotheses are \\npossible, although this one is superfluous: \\nthe work of the Right is done very well, and \\nspontaneously, by the Left on its own. \\nBesides, it would be naive to see an \\nembittered good conscience at work here. \\nFor the Right itself also spontaneously does \\nthe work of the Left. All the hypotheses of \\nmanipulation are reversible in an endless \\nwhirligig. For manipulation is a floating \\ncausality where positivity and negativity \\nengender and overlap with one another, \\nwhere there is no longer any active or \\n\\n\\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\npassive. It is by putting an arbitrary stop to \\nthis revolving causality that a principle of \\npolitical reality can be saved. It is by the \\nsimulation of a conventional, restricted per- \\nspective field, where the premises and \\nconsequences of any act or event are \\ncalculable, that a political credibility can be \\nmaintained (including, of course, \"objective\" \\nanalysis, struggle, etc.). But if the entire cycle \\nof any act or event is envisaged in a system \\nwhere linear continuity and dialectical \\npolarity no longer exist, in a field unhinged by \\nsimulation, then all determination evaporates, \\nevery act terminates at the end of the cycle \\nhaving benefited everyone and been scatter- \\ned in all directions. \\n\\nIs any given bombing in Italy the work of \\nleftist extremists, or of extreme right-wing \\nprovocation, or staged by centrists to bring \\nevery terrorist extreme into disrepute and to \\nshore up its own failing power, or again, is it \\na police-inspired scenario in order to appeal \\nto public security? All this is equally true, and \\nthe search for proof, indeed the objectivity of \\nthe fact does not check this vertigo of \\ninterpretation. We are in a logic of simulation \\nwhich has nothing to do with a logic of facts \\n\\n\\n\\n31 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nand an order of reasons. Simulation is \\ncharacterised by a precession of the model, of all \\nmodels around the merest fact— the models \\ncome first, and their orbital (like the bomb) \\ncirculation constitutes the genuine magnetic \\nfield of events. Facts no longer have any \\ntrajectory of their own, they arise at the \\nintersection of the models; a single fact may\" \\neven be engendered by all the models at once. \\nThis anticipation, this precession, this short- \\ncircuit, this confusion of the fact with its \\nmodel (no more divergence of meaning, no \\nmore dialectical polarity, no more negative \\nelectricity or implosion of poles) is what each \\ntime allows for all the possible interpreta- \\ntions, even the most contradictory — all are \\ntrue, in the sense that their truth is \\nexchangeable, in the image of the models \\nfrom which they proceed, in a generalised \\ncycle. \\n\\nThe communists attack the socialist \\nparty as though they wanted to shatter the \\nUnion of the Left. They sanction the idea \\nthat their reticence stems from a more \\nradical political exigency. In fact, it is because \\nthey don\\'t want power. But do they not want \\nit at this conjuncture because it is unfavor- \\n\\n\\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nable for the Left in general, or because it is \\nunfavorable for them within the Union of \\nthe Left — or do they not want it by \\ndefinition? When Berlinguer declares: \"We \\nmusn\\'t be frightened of seeing the commu- \\nnists seize power in Italy\", this means \\nsimultaneously: \\n\\n— that there is nothing to fear, since the \\ncommunists, if they come to power, will \\nchange nothing in its fundamental capitalist \\nmechanism, \\n\\n— that there isn\\'t any risk of their ever \\ncoming to power (for the reason that they \\ndon\\'t want to) — and even if they did take it \\nup, they will only ever wield it by proxy, \\n\\n— that in fact power, genuine power, no \\nlonger exists, and hence there is no risk of \\nanybody seizing it or taking it over, \\n\\n— but more: 1, Berlinguer, am not \\nfrightened of seeing the communists seize \\npower in Italy — which might appear evident, \\nbut not that much, since \\n\\n— this can also mean the contrary (no \\nneed of psychoanalysis here): I am frightened of \\nseeing the communists seize power (and \\nwith good reason, even for a communist). \\n\\nAll the above is simultaneously true. \\n\\n\\n\\n33 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the secret of a discourse that is no \\nlonger only ambiguous, as political discourses \\ncan be, but that conveys the impossibility of a \\ndeterminate position of power, the impossi- \\nbility of a determinate position of discourse. \\nAnd this logic belongs to neither party. It \\ntraverses all discourses without their want- \\ning it. \\n\\nWho will unravel this imbroglio? The \\nGordian knot can at least be cut. As for the \\nMoebius strip, if it is split in two, it results in \\nan additional spiral without there being any \\npossibility of resolving its surfaces (here the \\nreversible continuity of hypotheses). Hades \\nof simulation, which is no longer one of \\ntorture, but of the subtle, maleficent, elusive \\ntwisting of meaning 4 — where even those \\ncondemned at Burgos are still a gift from \\nFranco to Western democracy, which finds in \\nthem the occasion to regenerate its own \\nflagging humanism, and whose indignant \\nprotestation consolidates in return Franco\\'s \\nregime by uniting the Spanish masses \\nagainst foreign intervention? Where is the \\ntruth in all that, when such collusions \\nadmirably knit together without their \\nauthors even knowing it? \\n\\n\\n\\n34 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nThe conjunction of the system and its \\nextreme alternative like two ends of a curved \\nmirror, the \"vicious\" curvature of a political \\nspace henceforth magnetised, circularised, \\nreversibilised from right ot left, a torsion \\nthat is like the evil demon of commutation, \\nthe whole system, the infinity of capital \\nfolded back over its own surface: transfinite? \\nAnd isn\\'t it the same with desireand libidinal \\nspace? The conjunction of desire and value, \\nof desire and capital. The conjunction of \\ndesire and the law — the ultimate joy and \\nmetamorphosis of the law (which is why it is \\nso well received at the moment): only capital \\ntakes pleasure, Lyotard said, before coming \\nto think that we take pleasure in capital. \\nOverwhelming versatility of desire in \\nDeleure, an enigmatic reversal which brings \\nthis desire that is \"revolutionary by itself, \\nand as if involuntarily, in wanting what it \\nwants\", to want its own repression and to \\ninvest paranoid and fascist systems? A \\nmalign torsion which reduces this revolution \\nof desire to the same fundamental ambiguity \\nas the other, historical revolution. \\n\\nAll the referentials intermingle their \\ndiscourses in a circular, Moebian compulsion. \\n\\n\\n\\n35 \\n\\n\\n\\nlean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nNot so long ago sex and work were savagely \\nopposed terms: today both are dissolved into \\nthe same type of demand. Formerly the \\ndiscourse on history took its force from \\nopposing itself to the one on nature, the \\ndiscourse on desire to the one on power — \\ntoday they exchange their signifiers and \\ntheir scenarios. \\n\\nIt would take too long to run through \\nthe whole range of operational negativity, of \\nall those scenarios of deterrence which, like \\nWatergate, try to regenerate a moribund \\nprinciple by simulated scandal, phantasm, \\nmurder — a sort of hormonal treatment by \\nnegativity and crisis. It is always a question \\nof proving the real by the imaginary, proving \\ntruth by scandal, proving the law by \\ntransgression, proving work by the strike, \\nproving the system by crisis and capital by \\nrevolution, as for that matter proving \\nethnology by the dispossession of its object \\n(the Tasaday) — without counting: \\n\\n— proving theatre by anti-theatre \\n\\n— proving art by anti-art \\n\\n— proving pedagogy by anti-pedagogy \\n\\n— proving psychiatry by anti-psychiatry, \\netc., etc. \\n\\n\\n\\n36 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nEverything is metamorphosed into its \\ninverse in order to be perpetuated in its \\npurged form. Every form of power, every \\nsituation speaks of itself by denial, in order to \\nattempt to escape, by simulation of death, its \\nreal agony. Power can stage its own murder \\nto rediscover a glimmer of existence and \\nlegitimacy- Thus with the American presi- \\ndents: the Kennedys are murdered because \\nthey still have a politicaldimension. Others — \\nJohnson, Nixon, Ford— only had a right to \\npuppet attempts, to simulated murders. But \\nthey nevertheless needed that aura of an \\nartificial menace to conceal thay they were \\nnothing other than mannequins of power. In \\nolden days the king (also the god) had to die — \\nthat was his strength. Today he does his \\nmiserable utmost to pretend to die, so as to \\npreserve the bkssing of power. But even this is \\ngone. \\n\\nTo seek new blood in its own death, to \\nrenew the cycle by the mirror of crisis, \\nnegativity and anti-power: this is the only \\nalibi of every power, of every institution \\nattempting to break the vicious circle of its \\nirresponsibility and its fundamental non- \\nexistence, of its deja-vu and its deja-mort. \\n\\n\\n\\n37 \\n\\n\\n\\nlean Baudrillard \\n\\nStrategy of the Real \\n\\nOf the same order as the impossibility of \\nrediscovering an absolute level of the real, is \\nthe impossibility of staging an illusion. \\nIllusion is no longer possible, because the real \\nis no longer possible. It is the whole political \\nproblem of the parody, of hy persimulation or \\noffensive simulation, which is posed here. \\n\\nFor example; it would be interesting to \\nsee whether the repressive apparatus would \\nnot react more violently to a simulated hold- \\nup than to a real one? For the latter only \\nupsets the order of things, the right of \\nproperty, whereas the other interferes with \\nthe very principle of reality. Transgression \\nand violence are less serious, for they only \\ncontest the distribution of the real. Simulation \\nis infinitely more dangerous, however, since \\nit always suggests, over and above its object, \\nthat Jaw and order themselves might realty be nothing \\nmore than a simulation. \\n\\nBut the difficulty is in proportion to the \\nperil. How to feign a violation and put it to \\nthe test? Go and simulate a theft in a large \\ndepartment store: how do you convince the \\nsecurity guards that it is a simulated theft? \\nThere is no \"objective\" difference: the same \\n\\n\\n\\n38 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\ngestures and the same signs exist as for a real \\ntheft; in fact the signs incline neither to one \\nside nor the other. As far as the established \\norder is concerned, they are always of the \\norder of the real. \\n\\nGo and organise a fake hold-up. Be sure \\nto check that your weapons are harmless, \\nand take the most trustworthy hostage, so \\nthat no life is in danger (otherwise you risk \\ncommitting an offence). Demand ransom, \\nand arrange it so that the operation creates \\nthe greatest commotion possible — in brief, \\nstay close to the \"truth\" so as to test the \\nreaction of the apparatus to a perfect \\nsimulation. But you won\\'t succeed the web \\nof artificial signs will be inextricably mixed \\nup with real elements (a police officer will \\nreally shoot on sight; a bank customer will \\nfaint and die of a heart attack; they will really \\nturn the phoney ransom over to you) — in \\nbrief, you will unwittingly find yourself \\nimmediately in the real, one of whose \\nfunctions is precisely to devour every \\nattempt at simulation, to reduce everything \\nto some reality— that\\'s exactly how the \\nestablished order is, well before institutions \\nand justice come into play. \\n\\n\\n\\n39 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrittard \\n\\nIn this impossibility of isolating the \\nprocess of simulation must be seen the whole \\nthrust of an order that can only see and \\nunderstand in terms of some reality, because \\nit can function nowhere else. The simulation \\nof an offence, if it is patent, will either be \\npunished more lightly (because it has no \\n\"consequences\") or be punished as an offence \\nto public office (for example, if one triggered \\noff a police operation \"for nothing\") — but \\nnever as simulation, since it is precisely as such \\nthat no equivalence with the real is possible, \\nand hence no repression either. The \\nchallenge of simulation is irreceivable by \\npower. How can you punish the simulation \\nof virtue? Yet as such it is as serious as the \\nsimulation of crime. Parody makes obedience \\nand transgression equivalent, and that is the \\nmost serious crime, since it cancels out I he \\ndifference upon which the law is based, The \\nestablished order can do nothing against it, \\nfor the law is a second-order simulacrum \\nwhereas simulation is third-order, beyond \\ntrue and false, beyond equivalences, beyond \\nthe rational distinctions upon which function \\nall power and the entire social. Hence, failing \\nthe real, it is here that we must aim at order. \\n\\n\\n\\n40 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nThis is why order always opts for the \\nreal. In a state of uncertainty, it always \\nprefers this assumption (thus in the army \\nthey would rather take the simulator as a \\ntrue madman). But this becomes more and \\nmore difficult, for it is practically impossible \\nto isolate the process of simulation, through \\nthe force of inertia of the real which \\nsurrounds us, the inverse is also true (and \\nthis very reversibility forms part of the \\napparatus of simulation and of power\\'s \\nimpotency): namely, it is now impossible to isolate \\nthe process of the real, or to prove the real. \\n\\nThus all hold-ups, hijacks and the like \\nare now as it were simulation hold-ups, in \\nthe sense that they are inscribed in advance \\nin the decoding and orchestration rituals of \\nthe media, anticipated in their mode of \\npresentation and possible consequences. In \\nbrief, where they function as a set of signs \\ndedicated exclusively to their recurrence as \\nsigns, and no longer to their \"real\" goal at all. \\nBut this does not make them inoffensive. On \\nthe contrary, it is as hyperreal events, no \\nlonger having any particular contents or \\naims, but indefinitely refracted by each other \\n(for that matter like so-called historical \\n\\n\\n\\n41 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nevents strikes, demonstrations, crises, etc. 5 ), \\nthat they are precisely un verifiable by an \\norder which can only exert itself on the real \\nand the rational, on ends and means: a \\nreferential order which can only dominate \\nreferentials, a determinate power which can \\nonly dominate a determined world, but \\nwhich can do nothing about that indefinite \\nrecurrence of simulation, about that weight- \\nless nebula no longer obeying the law of \\ngravitation of the real — power itself eventu- \\n-!\\'y breaking apart in this space and \\nbecoming a simulation of power (disconnect- \\ned from its aims and objectives, and dedicated \\nto power effects and mass simulation). \\n\\nThe only weapon of power, its only \\nstrategy against this defection, is to reinject \\nrealness and referentiality everywhere, in \\norder to convince us of the reality of the \\nsocial, of the gravity of the economy and the \\nfinalities of production. For that purpose it \\nprefers the discourse of crisis, but also — why \\nnot? — the discourse of desire. \"Take your \\ndesires for reality!\" can be understood as the \\nultimate slogan of power, for in a non- \\nreferential world even the confusion of the \\nreality principle with the desire principle is \\n\\n\\n\\n42 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nless dangerous than contagious hyperreality. \\nOne remains among principles, and there \\npower is always right. \\n\\nHyperreality and simulation are deter- \\nrents of every principle and of every \\nobjective; they turn against power this \\ndeterrence which is so well utilised for a long \\ntime itself. For, finally, it was capital which \\nwas the first to feed throughout its history \\non the destruction of every referential, of \\nevery human goal, which shattered every \\nideal distinction between true and false, good \\nand evil, in order to establish a radical law of \\nequivalence and exchange, the iron law of its \\npower. It was the first to practice deterrence, \\nabstraction, disconnection, deterritorialisa- \\ntion, etc.; and if it was capital which fostered \\nreality, the reality principle, it was also the \\nfirst to liquidate it in the extermination of \\nevery use value, of every real equivalence, of \\nproduction and wealth, in the very sensation \\nwe have of the unreality of the stakes and the \\nomnipotence of manipulation. Now, it is this \\nvery logic which is today hardened even \\nmore against it. And when it wants to fight \\nthis catastrophic spiral by secreting one last \\nglimmer of reality, on which to found one \\n\\n\\n\\n43 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nlast glimmer of power, it only multiplies the \\nsigns and accelerates the play of simulation. \\n\\nAs long as it was historically threatened \\nby the real, power risked deterrence and \\nsimulation, disintegrating every contradic- \\ntion by means of the production of \\nequivalent signs. When it is threatened today \\nby simulation (the threat of vanishing in the \\nplay of signs), power risks the real, risks \\ncrisis, it gambles on remanufacturing artifi- \\ncial, social, economic, political stakes. This is \\na question of life or death for it. But it is too \\nlate. \\n\\nWhence the characteristic hysteria of \\nour time: the hysteria of production and \\nreproduction of the real. The other produc- \\ntion, that of goods and commodities, that of \\nla belle epoque of political economy, no longer \\nmakes any sense of its own, and has not for \\nsome time. What society seeks through \\nproduction, and overproduction, is the \\nrestoration of the real which escapes it. That \\nis why contemporary \"material\" production is itself \\nhyperreal, It retains all the features, the whole \\ndiscourse of traditional production, but it is \\nnothing more than its scaled-down refraction \\n(thus the hyperrealists fasten in a striking \\n\\n\\n\\n44 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nresemblance a real from which has fled all \\nmeaning and charm, all the profundity and \\nenergy of representation). Thus the hyper- \\nrealism of simulation is expressed every- \\nwhere by the real\\'s striking resemblance to \\n\\nitself. \\n\\nPower, too, for some time now produces \\nnothing but signs of its resemblance. And at \\nthe same time, another figure of power \\ncomes into play: that of a collective demand \\nfor signs of power — a holy union which forms \\naround the disappearance of power. Every- \\nbody belongs to it more or less in fear of the \\ncollapse of the political. And in the end the \\ngame of power comes down to nothing more \\nthan the critical obsession with power— an \\nobsession with its death, an obsession with \\nits survival, the greater the more it \\ndisappears. When it has totally disappeared, \\nlogically we will be under the total spell of \\npower — a haunting memory already fore- \\nshadowed everywhere, manifesting at one \\nand the same time the compulsion to get rid \\nof it {nobody wants it any more, everbody \\nunloads it on others) and the apprehensive \\npining over its loss. Melancholy for societies \\nwithout power: this has already given rise to \\n\\n\\n\\n45 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nfacism, that overdose of a powerful referen- \\ntial in a society which cannot terminate its \\nmourning. \\n\\nBut we are still in the same boat: none of \\nour societies knows how to manage its \\nmourning for the real, for power, for the \\nsocial itself, which is implicated in this same \\nbreakdown. And it is by an artificial \\nrevitalisation of all this that we try to escape \\nit. Undoubtedly this will even end up in socialism. By \\nan unforeseen twist of events and an irony \\nwhich no longer belongs to history, it is \\nthrough the death of the social that socialism \\nwill emerge — as it ts through the death of \\nGod that religions emerge. A twisted \\ncoming, a perverse event, an unintelligible \\nreversion to the logic of reason. As is the fact \\nthat power is no longer present except to \\nconceal that there is none. A simulation \\nwhich can go on indefinitely, since — unlike \\n\"true\" power which is, or was, a structure, a \\nstrategy, a relation of force, a stake — this is \\nnothing but the object of a social demand, and \\nhence subject to the law of supply and \\ndemand, rather than to violence and death. \\nCompletely expunged from the political \\ndimension, it is dependent, like any other \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\ncommodity, on production and mass con- \\nsumption. Its spark has disappeared — only \\nthe fiction of a political universe is saved. \\n\\nLikewise with work. The spark of \\nproduction, the violence of its stake no \\nlonger exists. Everybody still produces, and \\nmore and more, but work has subtly become \\nsomething else: a need {as Marx ideally \\nenvisaged it, but not at all in the same sense), \\nthe object of a social \"demand,\" like leisure, \\nto which it is equivalent in the general run of \\nlife\\'s options. A demand exactly proportional \\nto the loss of stake in the work process. 6 \\nThe samechangein fortune as for power: the \\nscenario of work is there to conceal the fact \\nthat the work- real, the production-real, has \\ndisappeared. And for that matter so has the \\nstrike-real too, which is no longer a stoppage \\nof work, but its alternative pole in the ritual \\nscansion of the social calendar. It is as if \\neveryone has \"occupied\" their work place or \\nwork post, after declaring the strike, and \\nresumed production, as is the custom in a \\n\"self- man aged\" job, in exactly the same \\nterms as before, by declaring themselves \\n(and virtually being) in a state of permanent \\nstrike. \\n\\n\\n\\n47 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nThis isn\\'t a science-fiction dream: \\neverywhere it is a question of a doubling of \\nthe work process. And of a double or locum \\nfor the strike process — strikes which are \\nincorporated like obsolescence in objects, like \\ncrisis in production. Then there is no longer \\nany strikes or work, but both simultaneously, \\nthat is to say something else entirely: a \\nwizardry of work, a trampe Yoeil, a scenodrama \\n(not to say melodrama) of production, \\ncollective dramaturgy upon the empty stage \\nof the social. \\n\\n1 1 is no longer a question of the ideology of \\nwork — of the traditional ethic that obscures \\nthe \"real\" labour process and the \"objective\" \\nprocess of exploitation — but of the scenario \\nof work. Likewise, it is no longer a question \\nof the ideology of power, but of the seen ario of \\npower. Ideology only corresponds to a \\nbetrayal of reality by signs; simulation \\ncorresponds to a short-circuit of reality and \\nto its reduplication by signs. It is always the \\naim of ideological analysis to restore the \\nobjective process; it is always a false problem \\nto want to restore the truth beneath the \\nsimulacrum. \\n\\nThis is ultimately why power is so in \\n\\n\\n\\n48 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\naccord with ideological discourses and \\ndiscourses on ideology, for these are all \\ndiscourses of truth — always good, even and \\nespecially if they are revolutionary, to \\ncounter the mortal blows of simulation. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe End of the Panopticon \\nIt is again to this ideology of the lived \\nexperience, of exhumation, of the real in its \\nfundamental banality, in its radical authen- \\nticity, that the American TV-verite experi- \\nment on the Loud family in 1971 refers: 7 \\nmonths of uninterrupted shooting. 300 \\nhours of direct non-stop broadcasting, \\nwithout script or scenario, the odyssey of a \\nfamily, its dramas, its joys, ups and downs — \\nin brief, a \"raw\" historical document, and the \\n\"best thing ever on television, comparable, at \\nthe level of our daily existence, to the film of \\nthe lunar landing.\" Things are complicated \\nby the fact that this family came apart during \\nthe shooting: a crisis flared up, the Louds \\nwent their separate ways, etc. Whence that \\ninsoluble controversy: was TV responsible? \\nWhat would have happened if TV hadn\\'t been \\nthere. \\n\\n\\n\\n49 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nMore interesting is the phantasm of \\nfilming the Louds as if TV wasn\\'t there. The \\nproducer\\'s trump card was to say: \"They \\nlived as if we weren\\'t there\". An absurd, \\nparadoxical formula — neither true, nor false: \\nbut Utopian. The \"as if we weren\\'t there\" is \\nequivalent to \"as if you were there\". It is this \\nUtopia, this paradox that fascinated 20 \\nmillion viewers, much more than the \\n\"perverse\" pleasure of prying. In this \"truth\" \\nexperiment, it is neither a question of secrecy \\nnor of perversion, but of a kind of thrill of the \\nreal, or of an aesthetics of the hyperreal, a \\nthrill of vertiginous and phony exactitude, a \\nthrill of alienation and of magnification, of \\ndistortion in scale, of excessive transparency \\nall at the same time. The joy in an excess of \\nmeaning, when the bar of the sign slips \\nbelow the regular water line of meaning: the \\nnon-signifier is elevated by the camera angle. \\nHere the real can be seen to have never \\nexisted (but \"as if you were there\"), without \\nthe distance which produces perspective \\nspace and our depth vision (but \"more true \\nthan nature\"). Joy in the microscopic \\nsimulation which transforms the real into \\nthe hyperreal. (This is also a little like what \\n\\n\\n\\n50 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nhappens in porno, where fascination is more \\nmetaphysical than sexual.) \\n\\nThis family was in any case already \\nsomewhat hyperrea! by its very selection: a \\ntypical, California- housed, 3 -garage, 5-chil- \\ndren, well-to-do professional upper middle \\nclass ideal American family with an orna- \\nmental housewife. In a way, it is .this \\nstatistical perfection which dooms it to \\ndeath. This ideal heroine of the American \\nway of life is chosen, as in sacrificial rites, to \\nbe glorified and to die under the fiery glare of \\nthe studio lights, a modern fatum. For the \\nheavenly fire no longer strikes depraved \\ncities, it is rather the lens which cuts through \\nordinary reality like a laser, putting it to \\ndeath. \"The Louds: simply a family who \\nagreed to deliver themselves into the hands \\nof television, and to die from it\", said the \\nproducer. So it is really a question of a \\nsacrificial process, of a sacrificial spectacle \\noffered to 20 million Americans. The \\nliturgical drama of a mass society. \\n\\nTV-verite. Admirable ambivalent terms: \\ndoes it refer to the truth of this family, or to \\nthe truth of TV? In fact, it is TV which is the \\nLoud\\'s truth, it is it which is true, it is it \\n\\n\\n\\n51 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nwhich renders true. A truth which is no \\nlonger the reflexive truth of the mirror, nor \\nthe perspective truth of the panoptic system \\nand of the gaze, but the manipulative truth \\nof the test which probes and interrogates, of \\nthe laser which touches and then pierces, of \\ncomputer cards which retain your punched- \\nout sequences, of the genetic code which \\nregulates your combinations, of cells which \\ninform your sensory universe. It is to this \\nkind of truth that the Loud family is \\nsubjected by the TV medium, and in this \\nsense it really amounts to a death sentence \\n(but is it still a question of truth?). \\n\\nThe end of the panoptic system. The eye of TV \\nis no longer the source of an absolute gaze, \\nand the ideal of control is no longer that of \\ntransparency. The latter still presupposes an \\nobjective space (that of the Renaissance) and \\nthe omnipotence of a despotic gaze. This is \\nstill, if not a system of confinement, at least a \\nsystem of scrutiny. No longer subtle, but \\nalways in a position of exteriority, playing on \\nthe opposition between seeing and being \\nseen, even if the focal point of the panopticon \\nmay be blind. \\n\\nIt is entirely different when with the \\n\\n\\n\\n52 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nLouds \"You no longer watch TV, TV \\nwatches you (live),\" or again: \"You no longer \\nlisten to Pas de Panique, Pas de Panique listens to \\nyou\" — switching over from the panoptic \\napparatus of surveillance lof Discipline and \\nPunish) to a system of deterrence, where the \\ndistinction between active and passive is \\nabolished. No longer is there any imperative \\nto submit to the model, or to the gaze. \"YOU \\nare the model!\" \"YOU are the majority!\" \\nSuch is the slope of a hyperrealist sociality, \\nwhere the real is confused with the model, as \\nin the statistic operation, or with the \\nmedium, as in the Loud\\'s operation. Such is \\nthe later stage of development of the social \\nrelation, our own, which is no longer one of \\npersuasion (the classical age of propaganda, \\nideology, publicity, etc.) but one of dis- \\nsuasion or deterrence: \"YOU are news, you \\nare the social, the event is you, you are \\ninvolved, you can use your voice, etc.\" A \\nturnabout of affairs by which it becomes \\nimpossible to locate an instance of the model, \\nof power, of the gaze, of the medium itself, \\nsince you are always already on the other \\nside. No more subject, focal point, center or \\nperiphery: but pure flexion or circular \\n\\n\\n\\n53 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\ninflection. No more violence or surveillance: \\nonly \"information,\" secret virulence, chain \\nreaction, slow implosion and simulacra of \\nspaces where the real-effect again comes \\ninto play. \\n\\nWe are witnessing the end of perspective \\nand panoptic space {which remains a moral \\nhypothesis bound up with every classical \\nanalysis of the \"objective\" essence of power), \\nand hence the very abolition of the spectacular. \\nTelevision, in the case of the Louds for \\nexample, is no longer a spectacular medium. \\nWe are no longer in the society of spectacle \\nwhich the situationists talked about, nor in \\nthe specific types of alienation and repression \\nwhich this implied. The medium itself is no \\nlonger identifiable as such, and the merging \\nof the medium and the message (McLuhan 7 ) \\nis the first great formula of this new age. \\nThere is no longer any medium in the literal \\nsense: it is now intangible, diffuse and \\ndiffracted in the real, and it can no longer \\neven be said that the latter is distorted by it. \\n\\nSuch immixture, such a viral, endemic, \\nchronic, alarming presence of the medium, \\nwithout our being able to isolate its effects — \\n\\n\\n\\n54 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nspecialised, like those publicity holograms \\nsculptured in empty space with laser beams, \\nthe event filtered by the medium — the \\ndissolution of TV into life, the dissolution of \\nlife into TV — an indiscernible chemical \\nsolution: we are all Louds, doomed not to \\ninvasion, to pressure, to violence and to \\nblackmail by the media and the models, but to \\ntheir induction, to their infiltration, to their \\nillegible violence. \\n\\nBut we must be careful of the negative \\ntwist discourse gives this: it is a question \\nneither of an illness nor of a viral complaint. \\nRather, we must think of the media as if they \\nwere, in outer orbit, a sort of genetic code \\nwhich controls the mutation of the real into \\nthe hyperreal, just as the other, micromole- \\ncular code controls the passage of the signal \\nfrom a representative sphere of meaning to \\nthe genetic sphere of the programmed signal. \\n\\nThe whole traditional mode of causality \\nis brought into question: the perspective, \\ndeterministic mode, the \"active,\" critical \\nmode, the analytical mode — the distinction \\nbetween cause and effect, between active \\nand passive, between subject and object, \\nbetween ends and means. It is in this mode \\n\\n\\n\\n55 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudriliard \\n\\n\\n\\nthat it can be said: TV watches us, TV \\nalienates us, TV manipulates us, TV informs \\nus . . . Throughout all this one is dependent \\non the analytical conception whose vanishing \\npoint is the horizon between reality and \\nmeaning. \\n\\nOn the contrary, we must imagine TV \\non the DNA model, as an effect in which the \\nopposing poles of determination vanish \\naccording to a nuclear contraction or \\nretraction of the old polar schema which has \\nalways maintained a minimal distance \\nbetween a cause and an effect, between the \\nsubject and an object: precisely, the meaning \\ngap, the discrepancy, the difference, the \\nsmallest possible marginof error, irreductible \\nunder penalty of reabsorption in an aleatory \\nand indeterminable process which discourse \\ncan no longer even account for, since it is \\nitself a determinable order. \\n\\nIt is this gap which vanishes in the \\ngenetic coding process, where indeterminacy \\nis less a product of molecular randomness \\nthan a product of the abolition, pure and \\nsimple, of the relation. In the process of \\nmolecular control, which \"goes\" from the \\nDNA nucleus tothe\"substance\"it\"informs,\" \\n\\n\\n\\n56 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nthere is no more traversing of an effect, of an \\nenergy, of a determination, of any message. \\n\"Order, signal, impulse, message\": all these \\nattempt to render the matter intelligible to \\nus, but by analogy, retranscribing in terms of \\ninscription, vector, decoding, a dimension of \\nwhich we know nothing — it is no longer \\neven a \"dimension,\" or perhaps it is the \\nfourth (that which is defined, however, in \\nEinsteinian relativity, by the absorption of \\nthe distinct poles of space and time). In fact, \\nthis whole process only makes sense to us in \\nthe negative form. But nothing separates \\none pole from the other, the initial from the \\nterminal: there is just a sort of contraction \\ninto each other, a fantastic telescoping, a \\ncollapsing of the two traditional poles into \\none another an IMPLOSION — an absorption \\nof the radiating model of causality, of the \\ndifferential mode of determination, with its \\npositive and negative electricity — an implo- \\nsion of meaning. This is where simulation begins. \\nEverywhere, in whatever political, bio- \\nlogical, psychological, media domain, where \\nthe distinction between poles can no longer \\nbe maintained, one enters into simulation, \\nand hence into absolute manipulation — not \\n\\n\\n\\n57 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\npassivity, but the non-distinction of active and \\npassive. DNA realises this aleatory reduction \\nat the level of the living substance. \\nTelevision itself, in the example of the Louds, \\nalso attains this indefinite limit where the \\nfamily vis-a-vis TV are no more or less active \\nor passive than is a living substance vis-a-vis \\nits molecular code. In both there is only a \\nnebula indecipherable into its simple ele- \\nments, indecipherable as to its truth. \\n\\nOrbital and Nuclear \\nThe nuclear is the apotheosis of \\nsimulation. Yet the balance of terror is \\nnothing more than the spectacular slope of a \\nsystem of deterrence that has crept from the \\ninside into all the cracks of daily life. The \\nnuclear cliff-hanger only seals the trivialised \\nsystem of deterrence at the heart of the \\nmedia, of the inconsequential violence that \\nreigns throughout the world, of the aleatory \\ncontrivance of every choice which is made \\nfor us. The slightest details of our behaviour \\nare ruled by neutralised, indifferent, equi- \\nvalent signs, by zero-sum signs like those \\nwhich regulate \"game strategy\" (but the \\ngenuine equation is elsewhere, and the \\n\\n\\n\\n58 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nunknown is precisely that variable of \\nsimulation which makes the atomic arsenal \\nitself a hyperreal form, a simulacrum which \\ndominates us all and reduces all \"ground- \\nlevel\" events to mere ephemeral scenarios, \\ntransforming the only life left to us into \\nsurvival, into a wager without takers — not \\neven into a death policy: but into a policy \\ndevaluated in advance). \\n\\nFt isn\\'t that the direct menace of atomic \\ndestruction paralyses our lives. It is rather \\nthat deterrence leukemises us. And this \\ndeterrence come from the very situation \\nwhich excludes the real atomic clash — excludes it \\nbeforehand like the eventuality of the real in \\na system of signs. Everybody pretends to \\nbelieve in the reality of this menace (one \\nunderstands it from the military point of \\nview, the whole seriousness of their exercise, \\nand the discourse of their \"strategy,\" is at \\nstake): but there are precisely no strategic \\nstakes at this level, and the whole originality \\nof the situation lies in the improbability of \\ndestruction. \\n\\nDeterrence excludes war — the anti- \\nquated violence of expanding systems. \\nDeterrence is the neutral, implosive violence \\n\\n\\n\\n59 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nof metastable or involving systems. There is \\nno subject of deterrence any more, nor \\nadversary, nor strategy — it is a planetary \\nstructure of the annihilation of stakes. \\nAtomic war, like that of Troy, will not take \\nplace. The risk of nuclear atomisation only \\nserves as a pretext, through the sophistication \\nof arms — but this sophistication exceeds any \\npossible objective to such an extent that it is \\nitself a symptom of nonexistence — to the \\ninstallation of a universal system of security, \\nlinkup, and control whose deterrent effect \\ndoes not aim for atomic clash at all (the latter \\nhas never been a real possibility, except no \\ndoubt right at the beginning of the cold war, \\nwhen the nuclear posture was confused with \\nconventional war) but really the much larger \\nprobability of any real event, of anything \\nwhich could disturb the general system and \\nupset the balance. The balance of terror is \\nthe terror of balance. \\n\\nDeterrence is not a strategy. It circulates \\nand is exchanged between the nuclear \\nprotagonists exactly like international capital \\nin that orbital zone of monetary speculation, \\nwhose flow is sufficient to control all global \\nfinance. Thus kill money (not referring to real \\n\\n\\n\\n60 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nkilling, any more than floating capital refers \\nto real production) circulating in nuclear \\norbit is sufficient to control all violence and \\npotential conflict on the globe. \\n\\nWhat stirs in the shadow of this posture, \\nunder the pretext of a maximal \"objective\" \\nmenace, and thanks to that nuclear sword of \\nDamocles, is the perfection of the best \\nsystem of control which has never existed. \\nAnd the progressive satellisation of the \\nwhole planet by that hypermodel of security. \\n\\nThe same goes for peaceful nuclear \\ninstallations. Pacification doesn\\'t distinguish \\nbetween the civil and the military: wherever \\nirreversible apparatuses of control are \\nelaborated, wherever the notion of security \\nbecomes absolute, wherever the norm of \\nsecurity replaces the former arsenal of laws \\nand violence (including war), the system of \\ndeterrence grows, and around it grows an \\nhistorical, social and political desert. A huge \\ninvolution makes every conflict, every \\nopposition, every act of defiance contract in \\nproportion to this blackmail which inter- \\nrupts, neutralises and freezes them. No \\nmutiny, no history can unfurl any more \\naccording to its own logic since it risks \\n\\n\\n\\n61 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nannihilation. No strategy is even possible any \\nmore, and escalation is only a puerile game \\nleft to the military. The political stake is dead. \\nOnly simulacra of conflict and carefully \\ncircumscribed stakes remain. \\n\\nThe \"space race\" played exactly the same \\nrole as the nuclear race. This is why it was so \\neasily able to take over from it in the \\'60\\'s \\n(Kennedy/Khrushchev), or to develop con- \\ncurrently ina mode of \"peaceful coexistence.\" \\nFor what is the ultimate function of the space \\nrace, of lunar conquest, of satellite launch- \\nings, if not the institution of a model of \\nuniversal gravitation, of satellisation, whose \\nperfect embryo is the lunar module: a \\nprogrammed microcosm, where nothing can be \\nleftiochancel Trajectory, energy, computation, \\nphysiology, psychology, the environment — \\nnothing can be left to contingency, this is the \\ntotal universe of the norm— the Law no \\nlonger exists, it is the operational immanence \\nof every detail which is law. A universe \\npurged of every threat to the senses, in a \\nstate of asepsis and weightlessness — it is this \\nvery perfection which is fascinating. For the \\nexaltation of the masses was not in response \\nto the lunar landing or the voyage of man in \\n\\n\\n\\n62 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nspace (this is rather the fulfillment of an \\nearlier dream) — no, we are dumbfounded by \\nthe perfection of their planning and technical \\nmanipulation, by the immanent wonder of \\nprogrammed development. Fascinated by the \\nmaximisation of norms and by the mastery \\nof probability. Unbalanced by the model, as \\nwe are by death, but without fear or impulse. \\nFor if the law, with its aura of transgression, \\nif order, with its aura of violence, still taps a \\nperverse imaginary, then the norm fixes, \\nhypnotises, dumbfounds, causing every \\nimaginary to involve. We no longer fantasise \\nabout every minutia of a program. Its \\nobservance alone unbalances. The vertigo of \\na flawless world. \\n\\nThe same model of planned infallibility, \\nof maximal security and deterrence, now \\ngoverns the spread of the social. That is the \\ntrue nuclearfallout: the meticulous opera Hon \\nof technology serves as a model for the \\nmeticulous operation of the social. Here, too, \\nnothing will be left to chance; moreover, this is the \\nessence of socialisation, which has been \\ngoing on for some centuries but which has \\nnow entered into its accelerated phase, \\ntowards a limit people imagined would be \\n\\n\\n\\n63 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean BaudriUard \\n\\nexplosive (revolution), but which currently \\nresults in an inverse, irreversible, implosive \\nprocess: a generalised deterrence of every \\nchance, of every accident, of every trans- \\nversality, of every finality, of every contra- \\ndiction, rupture or complexity in a sociality \\nilluminated by the norm and doomed to the \\ntransparency of detail radiated by data- \\ncollecting mechanisms. In fact, the spatial and \\nnuclear models do not even have their own \\nends: neither has lunar exploration, nor \\nmilitary and strategic superiority. Their \\ntruth lies in their being models of simulation, \\nvector models of a system of planetary \\ncontrol (where even the super-powers of this \\nscenario are not free — the whole world is \\nsatellised). 8 \\n\\nReject the evidence: with satellistation, \\nthe one who is satellised is not whom you \\nmight think. By the orbital inscription of a \\nspace object, the planet earth becomes a \\nsatellite, the terrestrial principle of reality \\nbecomes excentric, hyperreal and insignifi- \\ncant. By the orbital establishment of a \\nsystem of control like peaceful coexistence, \\nall terrestrial microsystems are satellised \\nand lose their autonomy. AH energy, all \\n\\n\\n\\n64 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nevents are absorbed by this excentric \\ngravitation, everything condenses and im- \\nplodes on the micro-model of control alone \\n(the orbital satellite), as conversely, in the \\nother, biological dimension everything con- \\nverges and implodes on the molecular micro- \\nmodel of the genetic code. Between the two, \\ncaught between the nuclear and the genetic, \\nin the simultaneous assumption of the two \\nfundamental codes of deterrence, every \\nprinciple of meaning is absorbed, every \\ndeployment of the real is impossible. \\n\\nThe simultaneity of two events in July \\n1975 illustrates this in a striking way: the \\nlinkup in space of the two American and \\nSoviet super-satellites, apotheosis of peaceful \\nexistence — and the suppression by the \\nChinese of character writing and conversion \\nto the Roman alphabet. This latter signifies \\nthe \"orbital\" establishment of an abstract \\nand model system of signs, into whose orbit \\nwill be reabsorbed all those once remarkable \\nand singular forms of style and writing. The \\nsatellisation of their tongue; this is the way \\nthe Chinese enter the system of peaceful \\ncoexistence, which is inscribed in their sky at \\n\\n\\n\\n65 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nthe very same time by the docking of the two \\nsatellites. The orbital flight of the Big Two, \\nthe neutralisation and homogenisation of \\neverybody else on earth. \\n\\nYet, despite this deterrence by the \\norbital authority — the nuclear code or \\nmolecular — events continue at ground level, \\nmishaps are increasingly more numerous, \\ndespite the global process of contiguity and \\nsimultaneity of data. But, subtly, these \\nevents no longer make any sense; they are \\nnothing more than a duplex effect of \\nsimulation at the summit. The best example \\nmust be the Vietnam war, since it was at the \\ncrossroads of a maximal historical or \\n\"revolutionary\" stake and the installation of \\nthis deterrent authority. What sense did that \\nwar make, if not that its unfolding sealed the \\nend of history in the culminating and decisive \\nevent of our age? \\n\\nWhy did such a difficult, long and \\narduous war vanish overnight as if by magic? \\n\\nWhy didn\\'t the American defeat (the \\ngreatest reversal in its history) have any \\ninternal repercussions? If it had truly \\nsignified a setback in the planetary strategy \\n\\n\\n\\n66 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nof the USA, it should have necessarily \\ndisturbed the internal balance of the \\nAmerican political system. But no such thing \\nhappened. \\n\\nHence something else took place. Ulti- \\nmately this war was only a crucial episode in \\na peaceful coexistence. It marked the advent \\nof China to peaceful coexistence. The long \\nsought-after securing and concretising of \\nChina\\'s non-intervention, China\\'s appren- \\nticeship in a global modus vivendi, the passing \\nfrom a strategy of world revolution to one of \\na sharing of forces and empires, the \\ntransition from a radical alternative to \\npolitical alternation in a now almost settled \\nsystem (normalisation of Peking-Washington \\nrelations): all this was the stake of the \\nVietnam war, and in that sense, the USA \\npulled out of Vietnam but they won the war. \\n\\nAnd the war\"spontaneously\"came toan \\nend when the objective had been attained. \\nThis is why it was de-escalated, demobilised \\nso easily. \\n\\nThe effects of this same remolding are \\nlegible in the field. The war lasted as long as \\nthere remained unliquidated elements ir- \\nreducible to a healthy politics and a discipline \\n\\n\\n\\n67 \\n\\n\\n\\nlean Baudrillard \\n\\nof power, even a communist one. When \\nfinally the war passed from the rersistance to \\nthe hands of regular Northern troops, it \\ncould stop: it had attained its objective. Thus \\nthe stake was a political relay. When the \\nVietnamese proved they were no longer \\nbearers of an unpredictable subversion, it \\ncould be handed over to them. That this was \\ncommunist order wasn\\'t fundamentally \\nserious: it had proved itself, it could be \\ntrusted. They are even more effective than \\ncapitalists in liquidating \"primitive\" pre- \\ncapitalist and antiquated structures. \\n\\nSame scenario as in the Algerian war. \\n\\nThe other aspect of this war and of all \\nwars since: behind the armed violence, the \\nmurderous antagonism between adversaries — \\nwhich seems a matter of life and death, and \\nwhich is played as such (otherwise you could \\nnever send out people to get smashed up in \\nthis kind of trouble), behind this simulacrum \\nof a struggle to death and of ruthless global \\nstakes, the two adversaries are fundamentally \\nas one against that other, unnamed, never \\nmentioned thing, whose objective outcome \\nin war, with equal complicity between the \\ntwo adversaries, is total liquidation. It is \\n\\n\\n\\n68 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\ntribal, communal, pre-capitalist structures, \\nevery form of exchange, language and \\nsymbolic organisation which must be abol- \\nished. Their murder is the object of war — \\nand in its immense spectacular contrivance \\nof death, war is only the medium of this \\nprocess of terrorist rationalisation by the \\nsocial — the murder through which sociality \\ncan be founded, no matter what allegiance, \\ncommunist or capitalist. The total complicity \\nor division of labour between twoadversaries \\n(who can even make huge sacrifices to reach \\nthat) for the very purpose of remolding and \\ndomesticating social relations. \\n\\n\"The North Vietnamese were advised to \\ncountenance a scenario of the liquidation of \\nthe American presence through which, of \\ncourse, honour must be preserved.\" \\n\\nThe scenario: the extremely heavy \\nbombardment of Hanoi- The intolerable \\nnature of this bombing should not conceal \\nthe fact that it was only a simulacrum to \\nallow the Vietnamese to seem tocountenance \\na compromise and Nixon to make the \\nAmericans swallow the retreat of their \\nforces. The game was already won, nothing \\nwas objectively at stake but the credibility of \\n\\n\\n\\n69 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nthe final montage. \\n\\nMoralists about war, champions of war\\'s \\nexalted values should not be greatly upset: a \\nwar is not any the less heinous for being a \\nmere simulacrum — the flesh suffers just the \\nsame, and the dead ex-combatants count as \\nmuch there as in other wars. That objective \\nis always amply accomplished, like that of the \\npartitioning of territories and of disciplinary \\nsociality. What no longer exists is the \\nadversity of adversaries, the reality of \\nantagonistic causes, the ideological serious- \\nness of war — also the reality of defeat or \\nvictory, war being a process whose triumph \\nlies quite-beyond these appearances. \\n\\nIn any case, the pacification {or deter- \\nrence) dominating us today is beyond war \\nand peace, the simultaneous equivalence of \\npeace and war. \"War is peace,\" said Orwell. \\nHere, also, the two differential poles implode \\ninto each other, or recycle one another — a \\nsimultaneity of contradictions that is both \\nthe parody and the end of all dialectic. Thus it \\nis possible to miss the truth of a war: namely, \\nthat it was well over before reaching a \\nconclusion, that at its very core, war was \\n\\n\\n\\n70 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nbrought to an end, and that perhaps it never \\never began. Many other such events (the oil \\ncrisis, etc.) never began, never existed, except \\nthat artificial mishaps — abstracts, ersatzesof \\ntroubles, catastrophes and crises intended to \\nmaintain a historical and psychological \\ninvestment under hypnosis. All media and \\nthe official news service only exist to \\nmaintain the illusion of actuality— of the \\nreality of the stakes, of the objectivity of the \\nfacts. All events are to be read in reverse, \\nwhere one perceives(as with the communists \\n\"in power\" in Italy, the posthumous, \\n\"nostalgic\" rediscovery of gulags and Soviet \\ndissidents tike the almost contemporary \\nrediscovery, by a moribund ethnology, of the \\nlost \"difference\" of Savages) that all these \\nthings arrive too late, with an overdue \\nhistory, a lagging spiral, that they have \\nexhausted their meaning long in advance and \\nonly survive on an artificial effervescence of \\nsigns, that all these events follow on \\nillogically from one another, with a total \\nequanimity towards the greatest inconsisten- \\ncies, with a profound indifference to their \\nconsequences (but this is because there are \\nnone any more: they burn out in their \\n\\n\\n\\n71 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nspectacular promotion) — thus the whole \\nnewsreel of \"the present\" gives the sinister \\nimpression of kitsch, retro and porno all at \\nthe same time — doubtless everyone knows \\nthis, and nobody really accepts it. The reality \\nof simulation is unendurable — more cruel \\nthan Artaud\\'s Theatre of Cruelty, which was \\nstill an attempt at a dramaturgy of life, the \\nlast flickering of an ideal of the body, blood \\nand violence in a system already sweeping \\ntowards a reabsorption of all the stakes \\nwithout a trace of blood. For us the trick has \\nbeen played. All dramaturgy, and even all \\nreal writing of cruelty has disappeared. \\nSimulation is master, and nostalgia, the \\nphantasmal parodic rehabilitation of all lost \\nreferentials, alone remain. Everything still \\nunfolds before us, in the cold light of \\ndeterrence (including Artaud, who is entitled \\nlike all the rest to his revival, to a second \\nexistence as the referential of cruelty). \\n\\nThis is why nuclear proliferation in- \\ncreases neither the chance of atomic clash \\nnor of accident — save in the interval where \\n\"young\" powers could be tempted to use \\nthem for non-deterrent or \"real\" purposes \\n(like the Americans did on Hiroshima— but \\n\\n\\n\\n72 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\nprecisely they alone were entitled to this \"use \\nvalue\" of the bomb, while al! those who have \\nsince acquired it are deterred from using it by \\nthe very fact of its possession). Entry into the \\natomic club, so amusingly named, very \\nrapidly removes (like syndicalisation for the \\nworking world) any inclination towards \\nviolent intervention. Responsibility, control, \\ncensorship, self-deterrence always increases \\nfaster than the forces or weapons at our \\ndisposal: this is the secret of the social order. \\nThus the very possibility of paralysing a \\nwhole country with the flick of a switch makes \\nit impossible that electrical engineers will \\never utilise this weapon: the entire myth of \\nthe revolutionary and total strike collapses at \\nthe very moment when the means to so are \\navailable — but alas, exactly because the means \\nto do so are available. This is deterrence in a \\nnutshell. \\n\\nTherefore it is altogether likely that one \\nday we shall see the nuclear powers \\nexporting atomic reactors, weapons and \\nbombs to every latitude. After control by \\nthreat will succeed the much more effective \\nstrategy of pacification by the bomb and by \\nits possession. \"Small\" powers, hoping tobuy \\n\\n\\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\ntheir independent strike force, will only buy \\nthe virus of deterrence, of their own \\ndeterrence. The same goes for the atomic \\nreactors we have already sent them: so many \\nneutron bombs knocking out all historical \\nvirulence, all risk of explosion. In this sense, \\nthe nuclear system institutes a universally \\naccelerated process of implosion, it conceals \\neverything around it, it absorbs all living \\nenergy. \\n\\nThe nuclear system is both the culminat- \\ning point of available energy and the \\nmaximisation of systems controlling all \\nenergy- Lockdown and control grow as fast \\nas (and undoubtedly even faster than) \\nliberating potentialities. This was already the \\naporia of modern revolutions. It is still the \\nabsolute paradox of the nuclear system. \\nEnergies freeze by their own fire power, they \\ndeter themselves. One can\\'t really see what \\nproject, what power, what strategy, what \\nsubject could possibly be behind this \\nenclosure, this vast saturation of a system by \\nits own hereafter neutralised, unusable, \\nunintelligible, non-explosive forces — except \\nthe possibility of an explosion towards the center, \\nor an implosion where all these energies are \\n\\n\\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nabolished in a catastrophic process (in the \\nliteral sense, that is to say in the sense of a \\nreversion of the whole cycle towards a \\nminimal point, of a reversion of energies \\ntowards a minimal threshold). \\n\\n\\n\\nTranslated by Paul Fobs \\nand Paul Patton \\n\\n\\n\\nNotes \\n\\n1.

The medium/ message confusion, of course, is a \\ncorrelative of the confusion between sender and \\nreceiver, thus sealing the disappearance of all the dual, \\npolar structures which formed the discursive \\norganisation of language, referring to the celebrated \\ngrid of functions in Jacobson, the organisation of alt \\ndeterminate articulation of meaning. \"Circular\" \\ndiscourse must be taken literally: that is, it no longer \\ngoes from one point to the other but describes a circle \\n\\n\\n\\n76 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Precession of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nthat indistinctly incorporates the positions of transmit- \\nter and receiver, henceforth unbeatable as such.

God alone does not \\nreply. But to the question: who made the psycho- \\nanalyst? the analyst quite easily replies: You. Thus is \\nexpressed, by an inverse simulation, the passage from \\nthe \"analysed\" to the \"analysand,\" from active to \\npassive, which only goes to describe the swirling, \\nmobile effect of the poles, its effect of circularity in \\nwhich power is lost, is dissolved, is resolved into \\ncomplete manipulation (this is no longer of the order \\nof the directive authority and the gaze, but of the \\norder of personal contact and commutation).

Paradox: all bombs are clean— their only \\npollution is the system of control and security they \\nradiate whtn thty art not detonattd. \\n\\n\\n\\n79 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nThree orders of appearance, parallel to \\nthe mutations of the law of value, have \\nfollowed one another since the Renaissance: \\n\\n— Counterfeit is the dominant scheme of \\nthe \"classical\" period, from the Renaissance \\nto the industrial revolution; \\n\\n— Production is the dominant scheme of \\nthe industrial era; \\n\\n— Simulation is the reigning scheme of \\nthe current phase that is controlled by the \\ncode. \\n\\nThe first order of simulacrum is based \\non the natural law of value, that of the \\nsecond order on the commercial law of value, \\nthat of the third order on the structural law \\nof value. \\n\\nThe Stucco Angel \\n\\nCounterfeit (and fashion at the same \\ntime) is born with the Renaissance, with the \\n\\n\\n\\na3 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\ndestructuring of the feudal order by the \\nbourgeois order and the emergence of open \\ncompetition on the level of the distinctive \\nsigns. There is no such thing as fashion in a \\nsociety of cast and rank, since one is assigned \\na place irrevocably, and so class mobility is \\nnon-existent. An interdiction protects the \\nsigns and assures them a total clarity; each \\neach sign then refers unequivocally to a status. \\nLikewise no counterfeit is possible with the \\nceremony — unless as black magic and sacri- \\nlege, and it is thus that any confusion of \\nsigns is punished: as grave infraction of the \\norder of things. If we are starting to dream \\nagain, today especially, of a world of sure \\nsigns, of a strong \"symbolic order,\" make no \\nmistake about it; this order has existed and it \\nwas that of a ferocious hierarchy, since \\ntransparency and cruelty for signs go \\ntogether. In caste societies, feudal or archaic, \\ncruel societies, the signs are limited in number, \\nand are not widely diffused, each one \\nfunctions with its full value as interdiction, \\neach is a reciprocal obligation between \\ncastes, clans or persons. The signs therefore \\nare anything but arbitrary. The arbitrary \\nsign begins when, instead of linking two \\n\\n\\n\\n84 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\npersons in an unbreakable reciprocity, the \\nsignifier starts referring back to the dis- \\nenchanted universe of the signified, common \\ndenominator of the real world toward which \\nno one has any obligation. \\n\\nEnd of the obliged sign, reign of the \\nemancipated sign, that ail classes will partake \\nequally of. Competitive democracy succeeds \\nthe endogomy of signs proper to statutory \\norder- At the same time we pass, with the \\ntransfer of values/ signs of prestige from one \\nclass to another, necessarily into counterfeit. \\nFor we have passed from a limited order of \\nsigns, which prohibits \"free production,\" to a \\nproliferation of signs according to demand. \\nBut the sign multiplied no longer resembles \\nin the slightest the obliged sign of limited \\ndiffusion: it is its counterfeit, not by \\ncorruption of an \"original\", but by extension \\nof a material whose very clarity depended on \\nthe restriction by which it was bound. No \\nlonger discriminating (if is no more than \\ncompetitive), unburdened of all restraint, \\nuniversally available, the modern sign still \\nsimulates necessity in taking itself as tied \\nsomehow to the world. The modern sign \\ndreams of the signs of the past and would \\n\\n\\n\\n85 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean BaudriUard \\n\\nwell appreciate finding again, in its reference \\nto the real, an obligation: but what it finds \\nagain is only a reason: this referential reason, \\nthis real, this \"natural\" off which it is going \\nto live. But this bond of designation is only \\nthe simulacrum of symbolic obligation: it \\nproduces neutral values only, that can be \\nexchanged in an objective world. The sign \\nhere suffers the same destiny as work. The \\n\"free\" worker is free only to produce \\nequivalents— the \"free and emancipated\" \\nsign is free only to produce the signs of \\nequivalence. \\n\\nIt is therefore in the simulacrum of a \\n\"nature\" that the modern sign finds its \\nvalue. Problematic of the \"natural/\\' meta- \\nphysics of reality and appearance: that is the \\nhistory of the bourgeoisie since the Renais- \\nsance, mirror of the bourgeois sign, mirror \\nof the classical sign. And still today the \\nnostalgia for a natural referent of the sign is \\nstill alive, in spite of the revolutions that \\nhave come to break up this configuration, \\nincluding one in production, where the signs \\nrefer no longer to any nature, but only to the \\nlaw of exchange, and come under the \\ncommercial law of value. \\n\\n\\n\\n86 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nIt is in the Renaissance that the false is \\nborn along with the natural. From the fake \\nshirt in front to the use of the fork as \\nartificial prosthesis, to the stucco interiors \\nand the great baroque theatrical machinery. \\nThe entire classical era belongs par excellence to \\nthe theatre. Theatre is the form which takes \\nover social life and all of architecture from \\nthe Renaissance on. It\\'s there, in the \\nprowesses of stucco and baroque art, that \\nyou read the methapysic of the counterfeit \\nand the new ambitions of Renaissance \\nman — those of a worldly demiurge, a transub- \\nstantiation of all of nature into a unique \\nsubstance, theatrical like social life unified \\nunder the sign of bourgeois values, beyond \\nall differences in blood, rank, or of caste. \\nStucco means democracy triumphant over \\nall artificial signs, the apotheosis of theatre \\nand fashion, and it betrays the new classes\\' \\ninfinite capabilities, its power to do anything \\nonce it has been able to break through the \\nexclusiveness of signs. The way lies open to \\nunheard-of combinations, to all the games, \\nall the counterfeits — the Promethean verve \\nof the bourgeoisie first plunged into the \\nimitation of nature before throwing itself into \\n\\n\\n\\n87 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nproduction. In the churches and palaces stucco \\nts wed to all forms, imitates everything — \\nvelvet curtains, wooden corniches, charnel \\nswelling of the flesh. Stucco exorcizes the \\nunlikely confusion of matter into a single \\nnew substance, a sort of general equivalent \\nof all the others, and isprestigious theatrical \\nly because is itself a representative sub- \\nstance, a mirror of all the others. \\n\\nBut simulacra are not only a game \\nplayed with signs; they imply social rapports \\nand social power. Stucco can come off as the \\nexhaltation of a rising science and technolo- \\ngy; it is also connected to the baroque — \\nwhich in turn is tied to the enterprise of the \\nCounter Reformation and the hegemony \\nover the political and mental world that the \\nJesuits — who were the first to act according \\nto modern conceptions of power — attempted \\nto establish. \\n\\nThere is a strict correlation between the \\nmental obedience of the Jesuits {\"perinde ac \\ncadaver\") and the demiurgic ambition to \\nexorcize the natural substance of a thing in \\norder to substitute a synthetic one. Just likea \\nman submitting his will to his organization, \\nthings take on the ideal functionality of the \\n\\n\\n\\n88 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\ncadaver. All technology, all technocracy are \\nincipiently there: the presumption of an ideal \\ncounterfeit of the world, expressed in the \\ninvention of a universal substance and of a \\nuniversal amalgam of substances. Reunify \\nthe scattered world (after the Reformation) \\nunder the aegis of a homogenous doctrine, \\nuniversalize the world under a single word \\n(from New Spain to Japan: the Missions), \\nconstitute a political elite of the >tate. with an \\nidentically centralized strategy: these are the \\nobjectives of the Jesuits. In order to accom- \\nplish this, you need to create effective \\nsimulacra: the apparatus of the organization \\nis one, but also is clerkly magnificence and \\nthe theatre (the great theatre of the \\ncardinals and grey eminences). And training \\nand education are other simulacra that \\naimed, for the first time ever in a systematic \\nmanner, at remodeling an ideal nature from \\na child, That architectural sauce of stucco \\nand baroque is a great apparatus of the same \\nkind. All of the above precedes the produc- \\ntivist rationality of capital, but everything \\ntestifies already — not in production, but in \\ncounterfeit to the same project of control \\nand universal hegemony — to a social scheme \\n\\n\\n\\n89 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nwhere the internal coherence of a system is \\nalready at work. \\n\\nOnce there lived in the Ardennes an old \\ncook, to whom the molding of buildings out \\nof cakes and the science of plastic patisserie \\nhad given the ambition to take up the \\ncreation of the world where God had left it, \\nin its natural phase, so as to eliminate its \\norganic spontaneity and substitute for it a \\nsingle, unique and polymorphous matter: \\nReinforced Concrete: concrete furniture, \\nchairs, drawers, concrete sewing machines, \\nand outside in the courtyard, an entire \\norchestra, including violins, of concrete — all \\nconcrete! Concrete trees with real leaves \\nprinted into them, a hog made out of \\nreinforced concrete, but with a real hog\\'s \\nskull inside, concrete sheep covered with real \\nwool. Camille Renault had finally found the \\noriginal substance, the paste from which \\ndifferent things can only be distinguished by \\n\"realistic\" nuance: the hog\\'s skull, leaves of \\nthe tree — but this was doubtless only a \\nconcession of the demiurge to his visitors . . , \\nfor it was with an adorable smile that this 80- \\nyear-old god received visitors to his creation. \\nHe sought no argument with divine creation; \\n\\n\\n\\n90 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\nhe was remaking it only to render it more \\nintelligible. Nothing here of a Luriferan \\nrevolt, or a will-to-parody, or of a desire to \\nespouse the cause of naive art. The Ardennes \\ncook reigned simply over a unified mental \\nsubstance (for concrete is a menial substance; \\nit allows, just like a concept, phenomena to \\nbe organized and divided up at will). His \\nproject was not so far from that of the \\nbuilders in stucco of baroque art, nor very \\ndifferent from the projection on the terrain \\nof an urban community in the current great \\nensembles. The counterfeit is working, so \\nfar, only on substance and form, not yet on \\nrelations and structures. But it is aiming \\nalready, on this level, at the control of a \\npacified society, ground up into a synthetic, \\ndeathless substance: an indestructible arti- \\nfact that will guarantee an eternity of power. \\nIs it not man\\'s miracle to have invented, with \\nplastic, a non-degradabte material, interrupt- \\ning thus the cycle which, by corruption and \\ndeath, turns all the earth\\'s substances \\nceaselessly one into another? A substance \\nout-of-the-cycle; even fire leaves an inde- \\nstructible residue. There is something in- \\ncredible about it, this simulacrum where you \\n\\n\\n\\n91 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\ncan see in a condensed form the ambition of a \\nuniversal semiotic- This has nothing to do \\nwith the \"progress\" of technology or with a \\nrational goal for science. It is a project of \\npolitical and cultural hegemony, the fantasy \\nof a closed mental substance— like those \\nangels of baroque stucco whose extremities \\nmeet in a curved mirror. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Automation of the Robot \\n\\nA whole world separates these two \\nartificial beings. One is a theatrical counter- \\nfeit, a mechanical and clock-like man; \\ntechnique submits entirely to analogy and to \\nthe effect of semblance. The other is \\ndominated by the technical principle; the \\nmachine overrides all. and with the machine \\nequivalence comes too. The automaton plays \\nthe part of courtier and good company; it \\nparticipates in the pre-Revolutionary French \\ntheatrical and social games. The robot, on \\nthe other hand, as his name indicates, is a \\nworker: the theatre is over and done with, \\nthe reign of mechanical man commences. \\nThe automaton is the analogy of man and \\n\\n\\n\\n92 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\nremains his interlocutor (they play chess \\ntogether!). The machine is man\\'s equivalent \\nand annexes him to itself in the unity of its \\noperational process. This is the difference \\nbetween a simulacrum of the first order and \\none of the second. \\n\\nWe shouldn\\'t make any mistakes on this \\nmatter for reasons of \"figurative\" resemblance \\nbetween robot and automaton. The latter is \\nan interrogation upon nature, the mystery \\nof the existence or non-existence of the soul, \\nthe dilemma of appearance and being. It is \\nlike God: what\\'s underneath it all, what\\'s \\ninside, what\\'s in the back of it? Only the \\ncounterfeit men allow these problems to be \\nposed. The entire metaphysics of man as \\nprotagonist of the natural theatre of the \\ncreation is incarnated in the automaton, \\nbefore disappearing with the Revolution. \\nAnd the automaton has no other destiny \\nthan to be ceaselessly compared to living \\nman— so as to be more natural than him, of \\nwhich he is the ideal figure. A perfect double \\nfor man, right up to the suppleness of his \\nmovements, the functioning of his organs \\nand intelligence — right up to touching upon \\nthe anguish there would be in becoming \\n\\n\\n\\n93 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillani \\n\\n\\n\\naware that there is no difference, that the \\nsoul is over with and now it is an ideally \\nnaturalized body which absorbs its energy. \\nSacrilege. This difference is then always \\nmaintained, as in the case of that perfect \\nautomaton that the impersonator\\'s jerky \\nmovements on stage imitate; so that at least, \\neven if the roles were reversed, no confusion \\nwould be possible. In this way the inter- \\nrogation of the automaton remains an open \\none, which makes it out to be a kind of \\nmechanical optimist, even if the counterfeit \\nalways connotes something diabolical. * \\n\\nNo such thing with the/obot. The robot \\nno longer interrogates appearance; its only \\ntruth is in its mechanical efficacy. It is no \\nlonger turned towards a resemblance with \\nman, to whom furthermore it no longer \\nbears comparison. That infinitesimal meta- \\nphysical difference, which made all the \\ncharm and mystery of the automaton, no \\nlonger exists; the robot has absorbed it for its \\nown benefit. Being and appearance are \\nmelted into a common substance of produc- \\ntion and work. The first-order simulacrum \\nnever abolished difference. It supposes an \\nalways detectable alteration between sem- \\n\\n\\n\\n94 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nblance and reality (a particularly subtle game \\nwith trompe-l\\'oeil painting, but art lives \\nentirely off of this gap). The second-order \\nsimulacrum simplifies the problem by the \\nabsorption of the appearances, or by the \\nliquidation of the real, whichever. It estab- \\nlishes in any case a reality, image, echo, \\nappearance; such is certainly work, the \\nmachine, the system of industrial production \\nin its entirety, in that it is radically opposed \\nto the principle of theatrical illusion. No \\nmore resemblance or lack of resemblance, of \\nGod, or human being, but an imminent logic \\nof the operational principle. \\n\\nFrom then on, men and machines can \\nproliferate. It is even their law to do so — \\nwhich the automatons never have done, \\nbeing instead sublime and singular mecha- \\nnisms. Men themselves only started their \\nown proliferation when they achieved the \\nstatus of machines, with the industrial \\nrevolution. Freed from all resemblance, \\nfreed even from their own double, they \\nexpand like the system of production, of \\nwhich they are only the miniaturized \\nequivalent. The revenge of the simulacrum \\nthat feeds the myth of the sorcerer\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\n95 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\napprentice doesn\\'t happen with the auto- \\nmaton. It is, on the other hand, the very law \\nof the second type; and from that law \\nproceeds still the hegemony of the robot, of \\nthe machine, and of dead work over living \\nlabor. This hegemony is necessary for the \\ncycle of production and reproduction. It is \\nwith this reversal that we leave behind the \\ncounterfeit to enter (re)production. We \\nleave natural law and the play of its forms to \\nenter the realm of the mercantile law of \\nvalue and its calculations of force. \\n\\nThe Industrial Simulacrum \\n\\nIt is a new generation of signs and \\nobjects which comes with the industrial \\nrevolution. Signs without the tradition of \\ncaste, ones that will never have known any \\nbinding restrictions. They will no longer \\nhave to be counterfeited, since they are going \\nto be produced all at once on a gigantic scale. \\nThe problem of their uniqueness, or their \\norigin, is no longer a matter of concern; their \\norigin is technique, and the only sense they \\npossess is in the dimension of the industrial \\nsimulacrum. \\n\\n\\n\\n96 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\nWhich is to say the series, and even the \\npossibility of two or of n identical objects. \\nThe relation between them is no longer that \\nof an original to its counterfeit — neither \\nanalogy nor reflection— but equivalence, \\nindifference. In a series, objects become \\nundefined simulacra one of the other. And \\nso, along with the objects, do the men that \\nproduce them. Only the obliteration of the \\noriginal reference allows for the generalized \\nlaw of equivalence, that is to say the very \\npossibility of production. \\n\\nThe entire analysis of production changes \\naccording to whether you no longer see in it \\nan original process, or even one that is at the \\ncore of all the others, but on the contrary a \\nprocess of absorption of all original being \\nand of introduction to a series of identical \\nbeings. Until now we have considered \\nproduction and work as potential, as force, as \\nhistorical process, as generic activity; the \\nenergetic-economic myth proper to modernity. \\nWe must now ask if production does not \\ninterfere in the order of signs, as a particular \\nphase — if it is not basically only an episode in \\nthe line of simulacra: that precisely when, \\nthanks to technique, potentially identical \\n\\n\\n\\n97 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nbeings are produced in an indefinite series. \\nThe immense energies that are at work \\nin technique, industry, and the economy \\nshould not hide the fact that it is basically \\nonly a matter of attaining to that indefinite \\nreproducibility. That is the challenge cer- \\ntainly to the \"natural\" order, but finally is \\nonly a second-order simulacrum, and rather \\ninadequate as an imaginary solution to the \\nproblem of mastering the world. By com- \\nparison to the era of the counterfeit (the \\ntime of the double and the mirror, of theatre \\nand the games of mask and appearance), the \\nserial and technical era of reproduction is all- \\nin-alt a time of lesser scope (the era that \\nfollows — that of models of simulation and of \\nthird-order simulacra— is of more consider- \\nable dimension). \\n\\nIt is Walter Benjamin who, in The Work of \\nArt in the Era of its Technical Reproductibility, first \\nelicited the implications essential in this \\nprinciple of reproduction. He shows that \\nreproduction absorbs the process of produc- \\ntion, changing its finalities and altering the \\nstatus of product and producer. He demon- \\nstrates this mutation on the terrain of art, \\ncinema and photography, because it is there \\n\\n\\n\\n98 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nthat open up, in the 20th century, new \\nterritories without a tradition of classical \\nproductivity, and that are placed immediately \\nunder the sign of reproduction. But we know \\nthat today all material production enters into \\nthis sphere. We know that now it is on the \\nlevel of reproduction (fashion, media, public- \\nity, information and communication net- \\nworks), on the level of what Marx negligently \\ncalled the nonessential sectors of capital (we \\ncan hereby take stock of the irony of history), \\nthat is to say in thesphere of simulacra and of \\nthe code, that the global process of capital is \\nfounded. Benjamin first (and later McLuhan) \\nunderstood technique not as a \"productive \\nforce\" (wherein marxist analysis is locked) \\nbut as medium, as form and principle of a \\nwhole new generation of sense. The fact \\nalone that anything might be simply re- \\nproduced, as such, in two copies, is already a \\nrevolution; you only have to consider the \\nshock of the African native seeing, for the \\nvery first time, two identical books. That \\nthese two products of technique should be \\nequivalent under the sign of socially necessary \\nwork is less important in the long run than \\nthe serial repetition of the same object (which \\n\\n\\n\\n99 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nis also that of individuals as force-of-work). \\nTechnique as medium dominates not only \\nthe \"message\" of the product (it\\'s use- value) \\nbut also the force-of-work that Marx wished \\nto make the revolutionary message of \\nproduction. Benjamin andMcLuhan saw this \\nmatter more clearly than Marx; they saw the \\ntrue message: tlie true ultimatum was in reproduction \\nitself, And that production no longer has any \\nsense; its social finality is lost in the series. \\nThe simulacra win out over history. \\n\\nFurthermore, this stage of seriaJ re- \\nproduction (that of the industrial mechanism, \\nof the factory belt, of expanded reproduction) \\nis ephemeral. As soon as dead work wins out \\nover living work — that is, as soon as the era \\nof primitive accumulation is over — serial \\nproduction yields to generation by means of \\nmodels. And here it is a question of a reversal \\nof origin and finality, for all the forms change \\nonce they are not so much mechanically \\nreproduced but even conceived from the poinl~of- \\nview of their very reproducibility, diffracted from a \\ngenerating nucleus we call the model. Here we \\nare in the third-order simulacra; no longer \\nthat of the counterfeit of an original as in the \\nfirst-order, nor that of the pure series as in \\n\\n\\n\\n100 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nthe second. Here are the models from which \\nproceed all forms according to the modulation \\nof their differences. Only affiliation to the \\nmodel makes sense, and nothing flows any \\nlonger according to its end, but proceeds \\nfrom the model, the \"signifier of reference,\" \\nwhich is a kind of anterior finality and the \\nonly resemblance there is. We are in \\nsimulation in the modern sense of the word, \\nof which industrialization is but the final \\nmanifestation. Finally, it is not serial re- \\nproducibility which is fundamental, but the \\nmodulation. Not quantitative equivalences, \\nbut distinctive oppositions. No longer the law \\nof capital, but the structural law of value. \\nAnd not only shouldn\\'t we look to technique \\nor the economy for the secrets of the code; it \\nis, on the contrary, the very possibility of \\nindustrial production that we should look for \\nin the genesis of the code and the simulacra. \\nEach order submits to the order following. \\nJust like the order of the counterfeit was \\nabolished by that of serial production (we can \\nsee how art has passed entirely into the realm \\nof the \"mechanical\"), so in the same way the \\nentire order of production is in the process of \\ntumbling into operational simulation. \\n\\n\\n\\n101 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nThe analyses of Benjamin and McLuhan \\nare situated on these limits of reproduction \\nand simulation, at the point where referential \\nreason disappears, and where production is \\nno longer sure of itself- In this sense they \\nmark a decisive progress compared to the \\nanalyses of Veblen and Goblot. These latter, \\ndescribing for example the signs of fashion, \\nstill refer to the classical configuration: the \\nsigns constitute a distinct material, have a \\nfinality and use for prestige, status, social \\ndifferentiation They manifest a strategy \\ncontemporaneous to that of profit and \\nmerchandise with Marx, at a time when you \\ncould still talk about the use-value of a sign or \\nof force- of -work, when purely and simply, \\none could still talk about an economy because \\nthere was still a Reason of the sign, and a \\nReason of production. \\n\\n\\n\\n102 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Metaphysic of the Code \\n\\n\"Leibniz, that mathematical spirit, \\nsaw in the mystic elegance of \\nthe binary system that counts \\nonly the zero and the one, the \\nvery image of creation. The \\nunity of the supreme Being, \\noperating by binary function in \\nnothingness, would have sufficed \\nto bring out of it all the beings.\" \\nMcLuhan \\n\\nThe great simulacra constructed by man \\npass from a universe of natural laws to a \\nuniverse of force and tensions of force, today to \\na universe of structures and binary oppositions. \\nAfter the metaphysic of being and appearance, \\nafter that of energy and determination, comes \\nthat of indeterminacy and the code. Cybernetic \\ncontrol generation from model, differential \\nmodulation, feed-back, question/ answer, etc.: \\nsuch is the new operational configuration (in- \\ndustrial simulacra are only operational). Digital- \\nly is its metaphysical principle (the God of \\nLeibniz), and DNA its prophet. It is in effect in \\nthe genetic code that the \"genesis of simulacra*\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n103 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\ntoday finds its most accomplished form. At \\nthe limit of an always more extensive \\nabolition of references and finalities, of the \\nloss of resemblance and designation, we find \\nthe digital program-sign, whose value is \\npurely tactical, at the intersection of the other \\nsignals (corpuscles of information/ test) and \\nwhose structure is that of a macro- molecular \\ncode of command and control, \\n\\nAt this level the question of signs, of their \\nrational destination, their real or imaginary, \\ntheir repression, their deviation, the illusion \\nthey create or that which they conceal, or \\ntheir parallel meanings— all of that is erased. \\nWe have already seen signs of the first order, \\ncomplex signs and rich in illusion, change, \\nwith the machines, into crude signs, dull, \\nindustrial, repetitive, echoless, operational \\nand efficacious. What a mutation, even more \\nradical still, with signals of the code, illegible, \\nwith no gloss possible, buried like program- \\nmatic matrices light-years away in the depths \\nof the \"biological\" body — black boxes where \\nall the commandments, all the answers \\nferment! End of the theatre of representation, \\nthe space of signs, their conflict, their silence; \\nonly the black box of the code, the molecular \\n\\n\\n\\n104 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\nemitter of signals from which we have been \\nirradiated, crossed by answers/questions like \\nsignifying radiations, tested continuously by \\nour own program inscribed in the cells. Jail \\ncells, electronic cells, party cells, micro- \\nbiological cells: always the search for the \\nsmallest indivisible element, whose organic \\nsynthesis would be made according to the \\ngivens of the code. But the code itself is but a \\ngenetic cell, a generator where myriads of \\nintersections produce all the questions and \\npossible solutions, so that choices (by whom?) \\ncan be made. No finality involved with these \\n\"questions\" (informational and signifying \\nimpulsions) but the answer, genetically un- \\nchangeable or inflected by minute and \\naleatory differences. Space is no longer even \\nlinear or one-dimensional: cellular space, in- \\ndefinite generation of the same signals, like \\nthe tics of a prisoner gone crazy with solitude \\nand repetition. Such is the genetic code: an \\nerased record, unchangeable, of which we are \\nno more than cells-for-reading. All aura of \\nsign, of significance itself is resolved in this \\ndetermination; all is resolved in the inscription \\nand decodage. \\n\\nSuch is the third-order simulacrum, our \\n\\n\\n\\n105 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nown. Such is the \"mystic elegance of the binary \\nsystem, of the zero and the one\", from which \\nall being proceeds. Such is the status of the sign \\nthat is also the end of signification: DNA or \\noperational simulation. \\n\\nAll of this is perfectly well summed up by \\nSebeok (\"Genetics and Semiotics\", in Versus): \\nNumerous observations confirm the \\nhypothesis that the internal organic world \\ndescends in a straight line from the \\nprimordial forms of life. The most remark* \\nable fact is the omnipresence of the DNA \\nmolecule. The genetic material of all \\norganisms known on earth is in great \\nmeasure made up of the nudeonic acids \\nDNA and RNA that contain in their \\ninformation structure, transmitted by \\nreproduction from one generation to \\nanother and furthermore gifted with the \\ncapacity of self- reproduction and imitation. \\nBriefly, the genetic code is universal, or \\nalmost Its deciphering was an immense \\ndiscovery, in the sense that it showed that \\n\"the two languages of the great polymers, \\nthe language of nudeonic acid and that of \\nprotein, are tightly correlated\" (Crick, \\n1966; Clarck/Narcker, 1968); The Soviet \\nmathematician Liapounov demonstrated \\nin 1963 that all living systems transmit by \\nprescribed canals with precision a small \\n\\n\\n\\n106 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nquantity of energy or of matter containing \\na great volume of information, which is \\nresponsible for the ulterior control of a \\ngreat quantity of energy and matter. In \\nthis perspective numerous phenomena, \\nbiological as well as cultural (stockage, \\nfeed-back, canalization of messages and \\nothers) can be seen as aspects of the \\ntreatment of information. In the last \\nanalysis information appears in great part \\nas the repetition of information, or even as \\nanother sort of information, a sort of \\ncontrol that seems to be a universal \\nproperty of terrestrial life, independent of \\nform or substance. \\n\\nFive years ago 1 drew attention to the \\nconvergence of genetics and linguistics — \\nautonomous disciplines, but parallel in the \\nlarger field of communication science (of \\nwhich animal semiotics alsi is a part). The \\nterminology of genetics is full of expres- \\nsions taken from linguistics and communi- \\ncation theory (Jacobson, 1968), which also \\nunderlined either the major resemblances \\nor the important differences of structure \\na nd of function between genetic and verbal \\ncodes. . . It is obvious today t hat the genetic \\ncode must be considered the most funda- \\nmental of all the semiotic networks, and \\ntherefore a prototype of all the other \\nsystems of signaling that animals use, man \\n\\n\\n\\n107 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean BaudriUard \\n\\n\\n\\nincluded. From this point of view, molecules \\nwhich are systems of quanta and behave \\nlike stable vehicles of physical information, \\nsystems of animal semiotics and cultural \\nsystems, including language, constitute a \\ncontinuous chain of stages, with always \\nmore complex energy levels, in the frame- \\nwork of a universal unique evolution. It is \\ntherefore possible to describe either lan- \\nguage or living systems from a unified \\ncybernetic point- of- view. For the present, \\nthis is only a useful analogy ora prediction. \\nA reciprocal rapprochement between animal \\ncommunication and linguistics can lead to a \\ncomplete knowledge of the dynamics of \\nsemiotics, and such a knowledge can be \\n.revealed, in the last analysis, to be nothing \\nless than the very definition of life. \\n\\nAnd so the current strategic model is \\ndesigned that everywhere is replacing the \\ngreat ideological model which constituted \\npolitical economy in its time. \\n\\nYou will find it under the rigorour sign \\nof \"science\" in the Chance and Necessity of \\nJacques Monod. The end of dialectical \\nevolution, it is the discontinuous indeter- \\nminism of the genetic code that now controls \\nlife — the teleological principle. Finality no \\nlonger belongs to the term; there is no longer \\n\\n\\n\\n108 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\na term, nor a determination. Finality is there \\nbeforehand, inscribed in the code. We see \\nthat nothing has changed— simply the order \\nof ends yields to the play of molecules, and \\nthe order of signifieds to the play of \\ninfinitesimal signifiers, reduced to their \\naleatory commutation. All the transcendant \\nfinalities reduced to a dashboard full of \\ninstruments. There is still, however, re- \\ncourse to a nature, to an inscription in \\n\"biological\" nature — in actuality, a nature \\ndistorted by fantasy like she always was, \\nmetaphysical sanctuary no longer of origin \\nand substance, but this time of the code; the \\ncode must have an \"objective\" basis. What \\ncould be better for that purpose than the \\nmolecule and genetics? Monod is the strict \\ntheologian of this molecular transcendance, \\nEdgar Morin the rapt disciple (A.D.N.* + \\nAdonait). But for one as well as the other, the \\nfantasy of the code, which is equivalent to \\nthe reality of power, is merged with \\nmolecular idealism. \\n\\nThus we find once more in history that \\ndelirious illusion of unting the world under \\n\\nTJ.N.A. \\n\\n\\n\\n109 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nthe aegis of a single principle — that of a \\nhomogenous substance with the Jesuits of \\nthe Counter Reformation; that of the \\ngenetic code with the technocrats of biologi- \\ncal science {but also linguistics as well), with \\nLeibniz and his binary divinity as precursor. \\nFor the program here aimed at has nothing \\ngenetic about it, it is a social and historical \\nprogram. That which is hypostatized in \\nbiochemistry is the ideal of a social order \\nruled by a sort of genetic code of macro- \\nmolecular calculation, of P.P.B.S. (Planned \\nProgramming Budgeting System), irradiat- \\ning the social body with its operational \\ncircuits. The technical cybernetic finds its \\n\"natural philosophy\" here, as Monod says. \\nThe fascination of the biological, of the \\nbiomedical dates from the very beginnings of \\nscience. It was at work in Spencerian \\norganicism (sociobiology) on the level of \\nsecond- and third-order structures (Jacob\\'s \\nclassification in The Logic of Life, it is active \\ntoday in modern biochemistry, on the level \\nof structures of the fourth-order). \\n\\nCoded similarities and dissimilarities: \\nthat is certainly the image of cyberniticized \\nsocial exchange. You only have to add \\n\\n\\n\\n110 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\"stereospecific complex\" in order to re-inject \\nintracellular communication; that Morin will \\ncome to transfigure into molecular Eros. \\n\\nPractically and historically, this signified \\nthe substitution of social control by the end \\n(and by a more or less dialectical providence \\nwhich surveys the accomplishment of this \\nend) for social control by anticipation, \\nsimulation and programming, and indeter- \\nminate mutation directed by the code. \\nInstead of a process which is finalized \\naccording to its ideal development, we \\ngeneralize from a moiM. Instead of aright to a \\nprophecy, we have the right of registration. \\nThere is no really radical difference between \\nthe two, only the schemes of control have \\nbecome fantastically perfected. From a \\ncapitalist-productivist society to a neo- \\ncapitalist cybernetic order that aims now at \\ntotal control. This is the mutation for which \\nthe biological theorization of the code \\nprepares the ground. There is nothing of an \\naccident in this mutation. It is the end of a \\nhistory in which, successively, God, Man, \\nProgress, and History itself die to profit the \\ncode, in which transcendance dies to profit \\nimmanence, the latter corresponding to a \\n\\n\\n\\n111 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nmuch more advanced phase in the vertiginous \\nmanipulation of social rapports. \\n\\nIn its indefinite reproduction, the system \\nputs an end to the myth of its origin and to all \\nthe referential values it has itself secreted along \\nthe way. Putting an end to its myth of \\nbeginning, it ends its internal contradictions \\n(no more real or referential to be confronted \\nwith), and it puts an end also to the myth of its \\nown end the revolution itself. What was \\nprofiled with revolution was the victory of \\nhuman and generic reference, of the original \\npotential of man. But if capital erases from the \\nmap generic man himself {for the sake of \\ngenetic man?) the Golden Age of the revolu- \\ntion was that of capital, where the myths of \\norigin and end still circulated. Once short- \\ncircuited the myths (and the only danger capital \\nconfronted historically came to it from this \\nmythical exigency of rationality that accompa- \\nnied it from the very beginning) in an opera tion- \\nality of fact and without discourse, once capital \\nitself has become its own myth, or rather an \\ninterminable machine, aleatory, something \\nlike a social genetic code, it no longer leaves \\nany room for a planned reversal; and this \\nis its true violence. It remains to be seen if this \\n\\n\\n\\n112 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\noperationality is not itself a myth, if DNA is not \\nalso a myth. \\n\\nOnce and for all there is posed, in effect, \\nthe problem of science as discourse. A good \\noccasion to pose it here, where this discourse \\nis absolutized with such candor. \"Plato, \\nHeraclitus, Hegel, Marx; these ideological \\nedifices, presented as a prion, were really \\na posteriori constructions, destined to justify \\na preconceived ethico- political theory . . . \\nThe only a priori for science is the postulate of \\nobjectivity, that forbids itself any part in this \\ndebate.\" (Monod). But this postulate results \\nitself from a never innocent decision for \\nobjectification of the world and of the \"real.\" In \\nfact it is the coherence of a certain discourse, and \\nall scientific movement is nothing but the space \\nof this discourse, never revealing itself as such, \\nand the \"objective\" simulacrum of which hides \\nthe political, strategic word. A little farther on, \\nfurthermore, Monod very well expresses the \\narbitrary nature of this phenomenon: \"We \\nmight wonder if all the\" invariance, conserva- \\ntions and symmetries that constitute the \\nscheme of scientific discourse are only fictions \\nsubstituted for reality so as to offer an \\noperational image. . . A logic founded on a \\n\\n\\n\\n113 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\npurely abstract principle of identity possibly \\nconventional. Convention, however, that human \\nreason seems incapable of doing without.\" You \\ncouldn\\'t say it better: that science has selected \\nitself as generating formula, a model discourse, \\nupon the faith of a conventional order (not just \\nany, however; that of total reduction). But \\nMonod slides rapidly into this dangerous \\nhypothesis of a \"conventional\" identity prin- \\nciple. It would be better to base science, more \\ncrudely, upon an \"objective\" reality. Physics is \\nthere to witness that identity is only a \\npostulate — it is within things, since there is \\n\"absolute identity of two atoms in the same \\nquantitative state\" Well then? Convention, or \\nobjective reality? The truth is that science is \\norganized, like any other discourse, on the \\nbasis of a conventional logic, but it demands for \\nits justification, like any other ideological \\ndiscourse, a real \"objective\" reference, in a \\nprocess of substance. If the principle of identity \\nis somehow \"true,\" even at the infinitesimal \\nlevel of two atoms, then the entireconventional \\nedifice of science that derives its inspiration \\nfrom that level is also \"true.\" The hypothesis of \\nthe genetic code, DNA, is also true and \\nunsurpassable. So it goes with metaphysics. \\n\\n\\n\\n114 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nScience accounts for things previously encircled \\nand formalized so as to be sure to obey it. \\n\"Objectivity\" is nothing else than that, and the \\nethic which comes to sanction this objective \\nknowlegde is nothing less than a system of \\ndefense and imposed ignorance, whose goal is \\nto preserve this vicious circle intact. * \\n\\n\"Down with all hypotheses that have \\nallowed the belief in a true world/\\' said \\nNietzsche. \\n\\nThe Tactile and the Digital \\n\\nThis regulation on the model of the \\ngenetic code is not at all limited to laboratory \\neffects or to the exalted visions of theoreticians. \\nBanal, everyday life is invested by these \\nmodels.

The most concrete form you see it in \\nis that of the test, of the question/ answer, of \\nthe stimulus/ response. All content is neutral- \\nized by a continual procedure of directed \\ninterrogation, of verdicts and ultimatums to \\ndecode, which no longer arise this time from \\nthe depths of the genetic code but that have the \\nsame tactical indeterminacy — the cycle of sense \\n\\n\\n\\n115 \\n\\n\\n\\n]ean Baudrillard \\n\\nbeing infinitely shortened into that of question/ \\nanswer, of bit or minute quantity of energy/ \\ninformation coming back to its beginning, the \\ncycle only describing the perpetual reactualiza- \\ntion of the same models.

Any place where the offer swallows \\nup the demand, where the question assimilates \\nthe answer, or absorbs and regurgitates it in a \\ndecodable form, or invents and anticipates it in \\na predictible form. Everywhere the same \\n\"scenario,\" the scenario of \"trial and error\" {guinea \\npigs in laboratory expenments), the scenario of \\nthe breadth of choice offered everywhere (\"the \\npersonality test\") — everywhere the test func- \\nctions as a fundamental form of control, by \\nmeans of the infinite divisibility of practices and \\nresponses. \\n\\nWe live by the mode of referendum precisely \\nbecause there is no longer any referential- Every \\nsign, every message (objects of \"functional\" use \\nas well as any item of fashion or televised news, \\npoll or electoral consultation) is presented to us \\nas question/ answer. The entire system of \\ncommunication has passed from that of a \\n\\n\\n\\n116 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nsyntactically complex language structure to a \\nbinary sign system of quest ion/ answer — of \\nperpetual test- Now tests and referenda are, we \\nknow, perfect forms of simulation: the answer \\nis called forth by the question, it is design-ated in \\nadvance. The referendum is always an ultimatum: the \\nunilateral nature of the question, that is no \\nlonger exactly an interrogation, but the \\nimmediate imposition of a sense whereby the \\ncycle is suddenly completed. Every message is a \\nverdict, just like the one that comes from \\npolling statistics. The simulacrum of distance \\n{or even of contradiction between the two \\npoles) is only — like the effect of the real the \\nsign seems to emit— a tactical hallucination. \\n\\nBenjamin analyzes concretely, on the level \\nof the technical instrument, this operation of \\nthe test: \\n\\nThe performance of the movie actor is \\ntransmitted to the public by means of an \\narray of technical instruments, with a \\ntwofold consequence. The camera that \\npresents the performance of the film actor \\nto the public need not respect the perform- \\nance as an integral whole. Guided by the \\ncameraman, the camera continually changes \\nits position with respect to the performance . \\nThe sequence of positional views which the \\n\\n\\n\\n117 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudriilard \\n\\n\\n\\neditor composes from the material supplied \\nhim constitutes the completed film. Hence, \\nthe performance of the actor is subjected to a \\nseries of optical tests This is the first \\nconsequence of the fact that the actor\\'s \\nperformance is presented by means of the \\ncamera. Also, the film actor lacks the \\nopportunity of the stage actor to adjust to t he \\naudience during the performance, since he \\ndoes not present his performance to the \\naudience in person. This permits the audience \\nto take the position of the critic, without \\nexperiencing any personal contact with the \\nactor The audience\\'s identification with the \\nactor is really an identification with the \\ncamera. Consequently the audience takes the \\nposition of the camera; its approach is that of \\ntesting. \\n\\nNote; The expansion of the field of the \\ntestable which mechanical equipment brings \\nabout for the actor corresponds to the \\nextraordinary expansion of the field of the \\ntestable brought about for the individual \\nthrough economic conditions. Thus, voca- \\ntional aptitude tests become constantly more \\nimportant. What matters in these tests are \\nsegmental performances of the individual. \\nThe film shot and the vocational aptitude test \\nare taken before a committee of experts, The \\ncamera director in the studio occupies a place \\nidentical with that of the examiner during \\n\\n\\n\\n118 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\naptitude tests. {Translated by H. Zohn in \\nSilu minai tons, from \"The Work of Art in the \\nAge of Mechanical Reproduction.\") \\n\\n\"The work of art with the dadaists \\nbecomes a projectile. It plunges in on the \\nspectator, it takes on a tactile quality. The \\ndiverging element in film is also first-and- \\nforemost a tactile element, based effectually \\non the constant change of place and camera \\nangles that stimulate the spectator.\" \\n\\nNo contemplation is possible. The images \\nfragment perception into successive sequences, \\ninto stimuli toward which there can be only \\ninstantaneous response, yes or no — the limit of \\nan abbreviated reaction. Film no longer allows \\nyou toquestion.lt questions you, and directly. It \\nis in this sense that the modern media call for, \\naccording to McLuhan, i a greater degree of \\nimmediate participation, an incessant response, \\na total plasticity (Benjamin compares the work \\nof the cameraman to that of the surgeon: \\ntactility and manipulation). The role of the \\nmessage is no longer information, but testing \\nand polling, and finally control (\"contra- role,\" in \\nthe sense that all your answers are already \\ninscribed in the \"role,\" on the anticipated \\nregisters of the code). Montage and codification \\n\\n\\n\\n119 \\n\\n\\n\\nlean Baudriilard \\n\\n\\n\\ndemand, in effect, that the receiver construe \\nand decode by observing the same procedure \\nwhereby the work was assembled. The reading \\nof the message is then only a perpetual \\nexamination of the code. \\n\\nEvery image, every media message, but \\nalso any functional environmental object, is \\na test — that is to say, in the full rigor of \\nthe term, liberating response mechanisms \\naccording to stereotypes and analytic models. \\nToday, the object is no longer \"functional\" in \\nthe traditional meaning of the word; it no \\nlonger serves you, it fete you. It has nothing to \\ndo with the object of yesteryear, no more than \\ndoes media news with a \"reality\" of facts. Both \\nobjects and information result already from a \\nselection, a montage, from a point-of-view. \\nThey have already tested \"reality,\" and have \\nasked only questions that \"answered back\" to \\nthem. They have broken down reality into \\nsimple elements that they have reassembled \\ninto scenarios of regulated oppositions, exactly \\nin the same way that the photographer imposes \\nhis contrasts, lights, angles on his subject (any \\nphotographer will teD you: you can do anything, \\nall you have to do is approach the original from \\nthe right angle, at that right moment or mood \\n\\n\\n\\n120 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\nthat will render it the correct answer to the \\ninstantaneous test of the instrument and its \\ncode). It is exactly like the test or the \\nreferendum when they translate a conflict or \\nproblem into a game of question/answer. And \\nreality, thus tested, tests you according to the \\nsame grill; you decode it according to the same \\ncode, inscribed within each message and object \\nlike a miniaturized genetic code. \\n\\nAll is presented today in a spread-out \\nseries, or as part of a line of products, and \\nthis fact alone tests you already, because you \\nare obliged to make decisions. This ap- \\nproximates our general attitude toward the \\nworld around us to that of a rending, and to \\na selectivedeciphering. We live less like users \\nthan readers and selectors, reading cells. But \\nnevertheless: by the same token you also are \\nconstantly selected and tested by the medium \\nitself. Just like cutting out a sample for the ends \\nof the survey, the media frame and excise their \\nmessage bundles, which are in fact bundles of \\nselected questions, samples of their audience. \\nBy a circular operation of experimental modifi- \\ncation, of incessant interference, like a nervous \\ninput, tactile and retractile, that explores an \\nobject by means of brief perceptive sequences, \\n\\n\\n\\n121 \\n\\n\\n\\nlean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nuntil it has been localized and controlled. What \\nthe media thereby localize and control are no \\nreal and autonomous groups, but samples, \\nsamples modelled socially and mentally by a \\nbarrage of messages. \"Public opinion\" is evident- \\nly the prettiest of these samples — not an unreal \\npolitical substance, but one that is hyperreal— a \\nfantastic hyperreality that lives only off of \\nmontage and test- manipulation. \\n\\nThe eruption of the binary scheme ques- \\ntion/answer is of an incalculable importance. It \\nrenders inarticulate every discourse. It short- \\ncircuits all that was, in a golden age come again, \\nthe dialectic of signifier and signified, of a \\nrepresenting and a represented. It is the end of \\nobjects whose meaning would be function, and \\nof opinions that \"representative\" representatives \\nwould be able to vote for. It is the end of the reai \\nintarrogation to which it was possible to answer \\n(the end especially to unanswerable questions). \\nThis process has been entirely overthrown. The \\ncontradictory process of true and false, of real \\nand the imaginary, is abolished in this hyperreal \\nlogic of \\'montage. Michel Tort, in his book \\nIntelligence Quotient, analyzes this quite well* \\n\"What is going to determine the answer to the \\nquestion is not the question as such in the form \\n\\n\\n\\n122 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nin which it was posed, it is also the idea that the \\ninterrogated subject forms about the most \\nappropriate tactic to adopt in function of the \\nconcept he has formed about the expectations \\nof the interrogator.\" And further \"The artifact \\nis something else entirely than a controlled \\ntransformation of the object for the ends of \\nknowledge, it is a rude interference with reality, \\nat the end of which it is impossible to say what \\nin reality can be objectively known and what is \\nthe result of technical intervention (medium). \\nThe I.Q. is an artifact.\" No more true or false, \\nbecause no more distinguishable hiatus between \\nquestion and response. In the light of the tests, \\nintelligence, like opinion — and more generally \\nthe entire process of meaning — is reduced to \\nthe\"ability to produce contrasting reactions toa \\ngrowing series of adequate stimuli.\" \\n\\nThis entire analysis sends us back to \\nMcLuhan\\'s formula: \"The Medium is the \\nMessage.\" It is in effect the medium— the very \\nstyle of montage, of decoupage, of interpella- \\ntion, solicitation, summation, by the medium — \\nwhich controls the process of meaning. And \\nyou understand why McLuhan saw in the era \\nof the great electronic media an era of tadile \\ncommunication. We are closer here in effect to \\n\\n\\n\\n123 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nthe tactile than to the visual universe, where \\nthe distancing is greater and reflection is always \\npossible. At the same time as touch loses its \\nsensorial sensual value for us (\"touching is an \\ninteraction of the senses rather than a simple \\ncontact of an object with the skin\"), it is possible \\nthat it returns as the strategy of a universe of \\ncommunication — but as the field of tactile and \\ntactical simulation, where the message becomes \\n\"massage,\" tentacular soliritatioa test. Every- \\nwhere you\\'re tested, palpated, the method is \\n\"tactical,\" the sphere of communication is \\n\"tactile.\" Without even speaking of the ideology \\nof \"contact,\" that is being pushed in all its forms \\nas a substitute for social rapport, there is an \\nentire social configuration that orbits around \\nthe test (the question/ answer cell) as around the \\ncommandments of the molecular code. \\n\\nThe political sphere entirely loses its \\nspecificity when it enters into the game of the \\nmedia and public opinion polls, that is to say into \\nthe sphere of the integrated circuit of question/ \\nanswer. The electoral sphere is in any case the \\nfirst great institution where social exchange is \\nreduced to obtaining an answer. It is due to this \\nsign-simplification that it is the first one to \\nbecome universal. Universal suffrage is the first \\n\\n\\n\\n124 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\nof the mass- media. AD through the 19 th and \\n20th centuries political and economic practice \\nmerge increasingly into the same type of \\ndiscourse. Propaganda and advertising fuse in \\nthe same marketing and merchandising of \\nobjects and ideologies. This convergence of \\nlanguage between the economic and the \\npolitical is furthermore what marks a society \\nsuch as ours, where \"political economy\" is fully \\nrealized. It is also by the same token its end \\nsince the two spheres are abolished in an \\nentirely separate reality, or hyperreality, which \\nis that of the media. There, too, there is an \\nelevation of each term to a greater power, that \\nof the third-order simulacra. \\n\\n\\'That many regret the \\'corruption\\' of \\npolitics by the media, deploring that TV and \\npublic opinion polls have replaced so quickly the \\nformation of opinion, shows only that they \\nunderstand nothing about politics.\" \\n\\nWhat is characteristic of this phase of \\npolitical hyperrealism is the necessary conjunc- \\ntion between the bipartite system and the entry \\ninto the play of the polls as mirror of this \\nalternating equivalence of the political game. \\n\\nThe polls are located in a dimension beyond \\nall social produdion. They refer only to a \\n\\n\\n\\n125 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nsimulacrum of public opinion. A mirror of \\nopinion analogous in its way to that of the Gross \\nNational Product imaginary mirror of the \\nproductive forces, without regard to their social \\nends or lack thereof. What is essential is only \\nthat \"it\" reproduces itself. The same as for \\npublic opinion: what is essential is that it \\nshadow itself incessantly in its own image. \\nTherein lies the secret of mass representation. \\nIt is no longer necessary that anyone produce an \\nopinion, all that is needed is that all reproduce \\npublic opinion, in the sense that all opinions get \\ncaught up in this kind of general equivalent, and \\nonce more proceed from it (reproduce it, \\nwhatever they make of it, on the level of \\nindividual choice). For opinions as for material \\ngoods: production is dead, long live reproduction. \\n\\nIf Md.uhan\\'s formula makes any sense it is \\ncertainly in this connection, * Public opinion is \\npar excellence at the same time medium and \\nmessage. And the polls that inform it are the \\nincessant imposition of the medium as message. \\nIn this sense they are of the same nature as TV \\nand the electronic media, which we have seen are \\nalso only a perpetual game of question/ answer, \\nan instrument of perpetual polling. \\n\\nThe poDs manipulate that which cannot be \\n\\n\\n\\n126 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\ndecided. Do they really affect the vote? True, \\nfalse? Do they give an exact picture of reality, or \\nsimple tendencies, or the refraction of this \\nreality in a hypers pace of simulation whose \\ncurve even is unknown? True, false, un- \\ndecidable. Their most sophisticated analyses \\nleave room always for the reversibility of the \\nhypotheses. Statistics is only casuistry. This un- \\ndecidabSe quality is proper to any process of \\nsimulation (see above, the crisis of indecision). \\nThe internal logic of these procedures (statistics, \\nprobability, operational cybernetics) is certainly \\nrigorous and \"scientific\\'*; somehow though it \\ndoes not stick, it is a fabulous fiction whose \\nindex of refraction in any reality (true or false) is \\nnil This is even what gives these models their \\nforcefulness. But also it is this which only leaves \\nthem, as truth, the paranoid projection tests of a \\ncase, or of a group which dreams of a \\nmiraculous correspondance of the real to their \\nmodels, and therefore of an absolute manipula- \\ntion. \\n\\nWhat is true of the statistics scenario is also \\ntrue of the regulated partition of the political \\nsphere the alternation of the forces in power, \\nmajority/ minority, substitutive, etc On this \\nlimit of pure representation, \"that\" no longer \\n\\n\\n\\n127 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\nrepresents anything. Politics die of thetoo-well- \\nregulated game of distinctive oppositions. The \\npolitical sphere (and that of power in general) \\nbecomes empty. This is somehow the payment \\nfor the accomplishing of the political class\\' \\ndesire that of a perfect manipulation of social \\nrepresentation. Surreptitiously and silently, all \\nsocial substance has left this machine in the \\nvery moment of its perfect reproduction. \\n\\nThe same thing holds true for the polls. \\nThe only ones who believe in them finally are \\nthe members of the political class, just as the \\nonly ones who really believe in advertising and \\nmarket studies are the marketeers and ad- \\nvertisers. This is not because they are parti- \\ncularly stupid (though that we can\\'t exclude \\neither) but because the polls are homogenous \\nwith the current functioning of politics. They \\ntake on a \"real\" tactical value, they come into \\nplay as a factor in the regulation of the political \\nclass according to its own rules of the game. It \\ntherefore has reason to believe in them, and it \\nbelieves. But who else does, really? It is the \\npolitical class\\' burlesque spectacle, hyper- \\nrepresentative of nothing at all, that people \\ntaste by way of the polls and media. There is a \\njubilation proper to spectacular nullity, and the \\n\\n\\n\\n128 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\nlast form it takes is that of statistical contemplation. \\nThis is accompanied always, we know, by a \\nprofound disappointment — the kind of dis- \\nillusion that the polls provoke in absorbing so \\nutterly the public\\'s voice, in short-circuiting all \\nprocess of expression. The fascination they \\nexercise is in accordance with this neutralization \\nby emptiness, with this trance they create by \\nanticipation of the image over all possible reality. \\n\\nThe problem of the polls e not at all that of \\ntheir objective influence. Just as for propaganda \\nor publicity, their influence is negated by \\nindividual or collective inertia or resistance. The \\nproblem is the operational simulation that they \\ninstitute over the entire spectrum of social \\npractices: that of the progressive kucemiazation of \\nall social substance, that is the substitution for \\nblood of the white lymph of media. \\n\\nThe question/answer cyde finds extension \\nin all domains. You slowly find that the entire \\nrealm of inquiries, polls, and statistics needs to be \\nlooked at again in relation to this radical suspicion \\nwhich falls upon their methods. But the selfsame \\nsuspicion falls on ethnology. Unless you admit \\nthat the natives are perfect naturals, incapable of \\nsimulation, the problem is the same as here the \\nimpossibility of obtaining for a directed question \\n\\n\\n\\n129 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrilkird \\n\\n\\n\\nany answer other than simu/afaf (other than \\nreproducing the question). It isn\\'t even certain \\nthat you can interrogate plants, animals, nor \\neven inert matter in the exact sciences with any \\nchance of \"objective*\\' response. As to the \\nresponse of the polled to the poll-takers, the \\nnatives to the ethnologist, the analyzed to the \\nanalyst, you can be sure that the circularity is \\ntotal the ones questioned always pretend to be as \\nthe question imagines and solicits them to be. \\nEven psychoanalytic transference and counter- \\ntransference fall today under the sway of this \\nstimulated, simulated-anticipated response, \\nwhich is none other than the very model of the \\nself-fulfilling prophecy. 5 We come then upon \\na strange paradox: the word of the polled, the \\nanalyzed, the natives, is irremediably short- \\ncircuited and lost, and it is on the basis of this \\nforeclosure that these respective disciplines — \\nethnology, psychoanalysis, sociology— are going \\nto be able to experience such marvelous \\ngrowth. But they become puffed-up on mere \\nwind, for it is in that respect that the circular \\nresponse of the polled, the analyzed, the natives \\nis all the same a challenge and a triumphant \\nrevenge. It is that they place the spotlight back \\non the question itself, isolate it in offering it the \\n\\n\\n\\n130 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nmirror of the answer it was awaiting, and show \\nit helpless to ever quit the vicious circle which in \\nfact is that of power. Just as in the electoral \\nsystem, in which the representatives no longer \\nrepresent anything because they control so well \\nthe responses of the electoral body. But \\neverything has, somehow, eluded the ruling \\nclass\\' grasp. This is why the dominated answer \\nof the natives is all the same a real response, a \\ndesperate vengeance that of letting power bury \\npower. \\n\\nThe \"advanced democratic\" systems are \\nstabilized on the formula of bipartite alterna- \\ntion. The monopoly in fact remains that of a \\nhomogenous political class, from left to right, \\nbut it must not be exercised as such. The one- \\nparty totalitarian regime is an unstable form — it \\ndefuses the political scene, it no longer assures \\nthe feed-back of public opinion, the minimal \\nflux in the integrated circuit which constitutes \\nthe transistorized poirical machine. Alternation, \\non the other hand, is the end of the end of \\nrepresentation, so solicitation is maximal by \\ndint of simple formal constraint, when you are \\napproaching most nearly a perfect competitive \\nequation between the two parties. This is \\nlogical. Democracy realizes the law of equi- \\n\\n\\n\\n131 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nvalence in the political order. This law is \\naccomplished in the back- and- forth movement \\nof the two terms which reactivates their \\nequivalence but allows, by the minute differ- \\nence, a public consensus to be formed and the \\ncycle of representation to be dosed. Operational \\ntheatre, where the only play staged anymore is \\nthe fulginous reflection of political Reason. The \\n\"free choice\" of individuals, which is the credo of \\ndemocracy, leads in fact precisely to the \\nopposite the vote becomes functionally obligatory: \\nif it is not legally,* it is by statistical constraint, \\nthe structure of alternation, reinforced by the \\npolls. 6 The vote becomes functionally aleatory\\'. \\nwhen democracy attains an advanced formal \\nstage, it distributes itself around equal quotients \\n(50/50). The vote comes toresembleaBrownian \\nmovement of particles or the calculation of \\nprobabilities. It is as if everyone voted by \\nchance, or monkeys voted \\n\\nAt this point it makes no difference at all \\nwhat the parties in power are expressing \\nhistorically and socially. It is necessary even that \\nthey represent nothing the fascination of the \\ngame, the polls, the formal and statistical \\ncompulsion of the game is all the greater. \\n\\n\"Classical\" universal suffrage already im- \\n\\n\\n\\n132 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nplies a certain neutralization of the political \\nfield, if only by the consensus on the rules of the \\ngame. But you can still distinguish therein the \\nrepresentatives from the represented, on the \\nbasis of a real social antagonism of opinion. It is \\nthe neutralization of this contradictory referent \\nunder the sign of a public opinion from now on \\nequal unto itself, mediated and homogenized by \\nanticipation (the polls) that will make alterna- \\ntion possible \"at the top\": simulation of \\nopposition between two parties, absorption of \\ntheir respective objectives, reversibility of the \\nentire discourse one into the other. 1 1 is, beyond \\nthe representing and the represented, the pure \\nform of representation — just as simulation \\ncharacterizes, beyond the signifier and the \\nsignified, the pure form of the political economy \\nof the sign— exactly as the floating of currency \\nand its countable relations characterizes, beyond \\nuse and exchange value, beyond all substance of \\nproduction, the pure form of value. \\n\\nIt might appear that the historical move- \\nment of capital carries it from one open \\ncompetition towards oligopoly, then towards \\nmonopoly — that the democratic movement \\ngoes from multiple parties toward bipartism, \\nthen toward the single party. Nothing of the \\n\\n\\n\\n133 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nsort: oligopoly, or the current duopoly results \\nfrom a tactical doubling of monopoly. In all domains \\nduopoly is the final stage of monopoly. It is not \\nthe public will (state intervention, anti-trust \\nlaws, etc.) which breaks up the monopoly of the \\nmarket — it is the fact that any unitary system, if \\nit wishes to survive, must acquire a binary \\nregulation. This changes nothing as far as \\nmonopoly is concerned. On the contrary, \\npower is absolute only if it is capable of \\ndiffraction into various equivalents, if it knows \\nhow to take off so as to put more on. This goes \\nfor brands of soap-suds as well as peaceful co- \\nexistence. You need two superpowers to keep \\nthe universe under control: a single empire \\nwould ojumble of itself. And the equilibrium of \\nterror alone can allow a regulated opposition to \\nbe established, for the strategy is structural \\nnever atomic. This regulated opposition can \\nfurthermore be ramified into a more complex \\nscenario. The matrix remains binary. It will \\nnever again be a matter of a duel or open \\ncompetitive struggle, but of couples of simul- \\ntaneous opposition. \\n\\nFrom the smallest disjunctive unity (ques- \\ntion/answer particle) up to the great alternating \\nsystems that control the economy, politics. \\n\\n\\n\\n134 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nworld co-existence, the matrix does not change: \\nit is always the 0/1, the binary scansion that is \\naffirmed as the metastableorhorneostaticfbrm of \\nthe current systems. This is the nucleus of the \\nsimulation processes which dominate us. It can \\nbe organized as a play of unstable variations, \\nfrom polyvalence to tautology, without threat- \\nening the strategic bipolar form: it is the divine \\nform of simulation. \\n\\nWhy are there two towers at New York\\'s \\nWorld Trade Center? AD of Manhattan\\'s great \\nbuildings were always happy enough to affront \\neach other in a competitive verticality, the \\nresult of which is an architectural panorama in \\nthe image of the capitalist system: a pyramidal \\njungle, all the buildings attacking each other. \\nThe system profiled itself in a celebrated image \\nthat you had of New York when you arrived \\nthere by boat. This image has completely \\nchanged in the last few years. The effigy of the \\ncapitalist system has passed from the pyramid \\nto the perforated card. Buildings are no longer \\nobelisks, but lean one upon the other, no longer \\nsuspicious one of the other, like columns in a \\nstatistical graph. This new architecture incarn- \\nates a system that is no longer competitive, but \\ncompatible, and where competition has disap- \\n\\n\\n\\n135 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\npeared for the benefit of the correlations. (New \\nYork is the world\\'s only city therefore that \\nretraces all along its history, and with a \\nprodigious fidelity and in all its scope, the actual \\nform of the capitalistic system — it changes \\ninstantly in function of the latter. No European \\ncity does so.) This architectural graphism is that \\nof the monopoly; the two W.T.C. towers, \\nperfect parallelepipeds a K i- mile high on a \\nsquare base, perfectly balanced and blind \\ncommunicating vessels. The fact that there are \\ntwo of them signifies the end of all competition, \\nthe end of all original reference. Paradoxically, if \\nthere were only one, the monopoly would not \\nbe incarnated, because we have seen how it \\nstabilizes on a dual form. For the sign to be pure, \\nit has to duplicate itself; it is the duplication of \\nthe sign which destroys its meaning This is \\nwhat Andy Warhol demonstrates also: the \\nmultiple replicas of Marilyn\\'s face are there to \\nshow at the same time the death of the original \\nand the end of representation. The two towers \\nof the W.T.C are the visible sign of the closure \\nof the system in a vertigo of duplicatioa while \\nthe other skyscrapers are each of them the \\noriginal moment of a system constantly \\ntranscending itself in a perpetual crisis and self- \\n\\n\\n\\n136 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nchallenge. \\n\\nThere is a particular fascination in this \\nreduplication. As high as they are, higher than \\nall the others, the two towers signify neverthe- \\nless the end of verticality, They ignore the other \\nbuildings, they are not of the same race, they no \\nlonger challenge them, nor compare themselves \\nto them, they look one into the other as into a \\nmirror and culminate in this prestige of \\nsimilitude. What they project is the idea of the \\nmodel that they are one for the other, and their \\ntwin altitude presents no longer any value of \\ntranscendence. They signify only that the \\nstrategy of models and commutations wins out \\nin the very heart of the system itself — and New \\nYork is really the heart of it — over the \\ntraditional strategy of competition. The build- \\nings of Rockefeller Center still direct their gaze \\none at the other into their glass or steel facades, \\nin the city\\'s infinite specularity. The towers, on \\nthe other hand are blind and no longer have a \\nfacade. All referential of habitat, of the facade as \\nface, of interior and exterior, that you still find \\nin the Chase Manhattan or in the boldest \\nmirror-buildings of the 60 \\'s, is erased. At the \\nsame time as the rhetoric of verticality, the \\nrhetoric of the mirror has disappeared. There \\n\\n\\n\\n137 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nremains only a series closed on the number two, \\njust as if architecture, in the image of the \\nsystem, proceeded only from an unchangeable \\ngenetic code, a definitive model. \\n\\nThe Hyperrealism of Simulation \\n\\nAH of this defines a digital space, a magnetic \\nfield for the code, with polarizations, diffrac- \\ntions, gravitations of the models and always, \\nalways, the flux of the smallest disjunctive \\nunities (the question/ answer cell, that is like the \\ncybernetic atom of meaning). We should \\ncompare this kind of control with the traditional \\nrepressive space, the police-space that still \\ncorresponded to a signifying violence. Space of \\nreactionary conditioning that took its inspira- \\ntion from the total Pavlovian disposition of \\nprogrammed, repetitive aggressions, and which \\nyou find again multiplied in scale in \"hard sell\" \\nadvertising and in the political propaganda of \\nthe 1930\\'s. Raw industrial violence, aiming to \\ninduce behaviors of terror and of animal \\nobeisance. All of that no longer has any \\nmeaning. The totalitarian, bureaucratic concen- \\ntration is a scheme which dates from the era of \\nthe mercantile law of value. The system of \\n\\n\\n\\n138 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nequivalences imposes in effect the form of a \\ngeneral equivalent, and therefore the central- \\nization of a global process. Archaic rationality \\ncompared to that of simulation; there is no \\nlonger a single general equivalent, but a \\ndiffraction of models that plays a regulatory \\nrole. No longer the form of the general \\nequivalent but that of distinctive opposition. \\nFrom injunction you pass to disjunction by the \\ncode, from the ultimatum you pass to the \\nsolicitation, from the required passivity to \\nmodels constructed all at once on the basis of \\nthe \"active response\" of the subject, on its \\nimplication, its \"ludic\" participation, etc., towards \\na total environmental model made out of \\nincessant spontaneous responses of joyous \\nfeed-back and irradiating contact. This is the \\n\"concretization of the general atmosphere,\" \\naccording to Nicolas Schbffer, the great festival \\nof Participation, made out of myriads of stimuli, \\nminiaturized tests, infinitely divisible question/ \\nanswers, all magnetized by a few great models \\nin the luminous field of the code. \\n\\nHere comes the time of the great Culture \\nof tactile communication, under the sign of the \\ntechnico- luminous cinematic space of total \\nspa no-dynamic theatre \\n\\n\\n\\n139 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a completely imaginary contact- \\nworld of sensorial mimetics and tactile mysticism; \\nit is essentially an entire ecology that is grafted \\non this universe of operational simulation, \\nmultistimulatton and multiresponse We natur- \\nalize this incessant test of successful adaptation \\nin assimilating it into animal mimesis. \"The \\nadaptation of animals to the colors and forms of \\ntheir milieu is a valid phenomenon for man\" \\n(Nicolas Schoffer), and the same for Indians, \\nwith their \"innate sense of ecology\"! Tropisms, \\nmimetics, empathy: the complete ecological \\nEvangel of open systems, with positive or \\nnegative feedback, is going to rush into this \\nbreech, with an ideology of regulation by \\ninformation which is only the avatar, according \\nto a more flexible rationality, of Pavlov\\'s reflex. \\nSo it is that we graduate from electro-shock \\ntherapy to bodily expression as a means of \\nconditioning mental health.

Here cruelty is replaced by \\n\"minimal and maximal stimulus thresholds.\" by \\nthe invention of \"perceptive codes calculated on \\nthe basis of saturation thresholds.\" Even the \\ngood old \"catharsis\" of the classical theatre of \\nthe passions has become today homeopathy by \\nsimulation. So goes creativity. \\n\\nThis also means the collapse of reality into \\nhyperrealism, in the minute duplication of the \\nreal, preferably on the basis of another \\nreproductive medium— advertising, photo, etc. \\nFrom medium to medium the real is volatilized; \\n\\n\\n\\n141 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nit becomes an allegory of death, but it is \\nreinforced by its very destruction; it becomes \\nthe real for the real fetish of the lost object — no \\nlonger object of representation, but ecstasy of \\ndenegation and of its own ritual extermination: \\nthe hyperreal. \\n\\nRealism had already begun this tendency. \\nThe rhetoric of the real already meant that the \\nstatus of the latter had been gravely menaced \\n(the golden age is that of language\\'s innocence, \\nwhere it doesn\\'t have to add an \"effect of \\nreality\" to what is said). Surrealism is still \\nsolidary with the realism it contests, but \\naugments its intensity by setting it off against \\nthe imaginary. The hyperreal represents a \\nmuch more advanced phase, in the sense that \\neven this contradiction between the real and the \\nimaginary is effaced The unreal is no longer \\nthat of dream or of fantasy, of a beyond or a \\nwithin, it is that of a hallucinatory resemblance of the \\nreal with itself. To exist from the crisis of \\nrepresentation, you have to lock the real up in \\npure repetition. Before emerging in popart and \\npictorial neo-realism, this tendency is at work \\nalready in the new novel. The project is already \\nthere to empty out the real, extirpate all \\npsychology, all subjectivity, to move the real \\n\\n\\n\\n142 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nback to pure objectivity. In fact this objectivity is \\nonly that of the pure look — objectivity at last \\nliberated from the object, that is nothing more \\nthan the blind relay station of the look which \\nsweeps over it. Circular seduction where you \\ncan detect easily the unconscious desire of no \\nlonger being visible at all. \\n\\nThis is certainly the impression that the \\nnew novel leaves: this rage for eliding sense in a \\nminute and blind reality. Syntax and semantics \\nhave disappeared — there is no longer apparition, \\nbut instead subpoena of the object, severe \\ninterrogation of its scattered fragments — \\nneither metaphor nor metonymy: successive \\nimmanence under the policing structure of the \\nlook. This \"objective\" minuteness arouses a \\nvertigo of reality, a vertigo of death on the limits \\nof representation-for-the-sake-of-represent- \\nation. End of the old illusions of relief, \\nperspective and depth (spatial and psychological) \\nbound to the perception of the object: it is the \\nentire optic, the view becomeoperationalonthe \\nsurface of things, it is the look become \\nmolecular code of the object. \\n\\nSeveral modalities of this vertigo of \\nrealistic simulation are possible \\n\\n\\n\\n143 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nI.

The endlessly reflected vision: all the \\ngames of duplication and reduplication of the \\nobject in detail This multiplication is presented \\nas a deepening, that is for a critial metalanguage, \\nand it was doubtless true in a reflexive \\nconfiguration of the sign, in a dialectic of the \\nmirror. From now on, though, this indefinite \\nrefraction is only another type of seriality. The \\nreal is no longer reflected, instead it feeds off \\nitself till the point of emaciation. \\n\\nID. The properly serial form f Andy Warhol). \\nHere not only the syntagmatic dimension is \\nabolished, but the paradigmatic as well. Since \\nthere no longer is any formal flection or even \\ninternal reflection, but contiguity of thesame — \\nflection and reflection zero. Like those two twin \\nsisters in a dirty picture the charnel reality of \\ntheir bodies is erased by the resemblance. How \\nto invest your energies in one, when her beauty \\nis immediately duplicated by the other? The \\nregard can go only from one to the other, all \\nvision is locked into this coming- an d-going. \\nSubtle way of murdering the original, but also \\n\\n\\n\\n144 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nsingular seduction, where all attention to the \\nobject is intercepted by its infinite diffraction \\ninto itself (inverted scenario of the Platonic \\nmyth of the reunion of the separated halves of \\nthe symbol — here the sign multiplies like \\nprotozoans). This seduction is possibly that of \\ndeath, in the sense that for sexual beings, death \\nis possibly not nothingness, but simply the \\nmode of reproduction anterior to the sexual. \\nThis generation by model along an endless \\nchain that in effect recalls the protozoans and is \\nopposed to a sexual mode that we tend \\ninaccurately, to confuse with life itself. \\n\\nIV. But this pure mechanization is doubtless \\nonly a paradoxical limit: the true generating \\nformula, that which englobes all the others, and \\nwhich is somehow the stabilized form of the \\ncode, is that of binarity, of digitality. Not pure \\nrepetition, but the minimal separation, the least \\namount of inflection between the two terms, \\nthat is to say the \"very smallest common \\nparadigm\" that the fiction of sense could \\npossibly support. Combination of differentia- \\ntion internal to the pictorial object and to the \\nobject of consummation, this simulation retreats \\nin contemporary art to be no more than the \\n\\n\\n\\n145 \\n\\n\\n\\njean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nminute difference that still separates the \\nhyperreal from hyperpainting. The latter \\npretends to extend right up to a sacrificial \\neffacement before the real, but you know how \\nall these prestigious elements in painting \\nresuscitate in this minute difference: all of \\npainting takes refuge in the border that \\nseparates the painted surface and the wall. And \\nin the signature: metaphysical sign of painting \\nand of the whole metaphysic of representation, \\nat the limit where it takes itself for model (the \\n\"pure look\") and turns back upon itself in the \\ncompulsive repetition of the code. \\n\\nThe very definition of the real becomes: \\nthat of which it is possible to give an equivalent \\nreproduction. This is contemporaneous with a \\nscience that postulates that a process can be \\nperfectly reproduced in aset of given conditions, \\nand also with the industrial rationality that \\npostulates a universal system of equivalency \\n(classical representation is not equivalence, it is \\ntranscription,, interpretation, commentary). At \\nthe limit of this process of reproducibility, the \\nreal is not only what can be reproduced, but that \\nwhich is always already reproduced. The hyperreal. \\n\\nAnd so: end of the real, and end of art, by \\ntotal absorption one into the other? No: \\n\\n\\n\\n146 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nhyperrealism is the limit of art, and of the real, \\nby respective exchange, on the level of the \\nsimulacrum, of the privileges and the prejudices \\nwhich are their basis. The hyperreal transcends \\nrepresentation (cf, J.F. Lyotard, L\\'Art Vwanl, \\nnumber on hyperrealism) only because it is \\nentirely in simulation. The tourniquet of \\nrepresentation tightens madly, but of an \\nimplosive madness, that, far from eccentric \\n(marginal) inclines towards the center to its \\nown infinite repetition. Analogous to the \\ndistancing characteristic of the dream, that \\nmakes us say that we are only dreaming; but \\nthis is only the game of censure and of \\nperpetuation of the dream. Hyperrealism is \\nmade an integral part of a coded reality that it \\nperpetuates, and for which it changes nothing. \\nIn fact, we should turn our definition of \\nhyperrealism inside out It is rmhty itself today that is \\nhyperrealist. Surrealism\\'s secret already was that \\nthe most banal reality could become surreal, but \\nonly in certain privileged moments that never- \\ntheless are still connected with art and the imag- \\ninary. Today it is quotidian reality in its \\nentirety — political, social, historical and eco- \\nnomic—that from now on incorporates the \\nSimula tory dimension of hyperrealism. We live \\n\\n\\n\\n147 \\n\\n\\n\\njean Baudritlard \\n\\n\\n\\neverywhere already in an \"esthetic\" hallucination \\nof reality- The old slogan \"truth is stranger than \\nfiction,\" that still corresponded to the surrealist \\nphase of this estheticizah\\'on of life, is obsolete. \\nThere is no more fiction that life could possibly \\nconfront, even victoriously — it is reality itself \\nthat disappears utterly in the game of reality- \\nradical disenchantment, the cool and cybernetic \\nphase following the hot stage of fantasy. \\n\\nIt is thus that for guilt, anguish and death \\nthere can be substituted the total joy of the signs \\nof guilt, despair, violence and death. It is the very \\neuphoria of simulation, that sees itself as the \\nabolition of cause and effect, the beginning and \\nthe end, for all of which it substitutes reduplica- \\ntion. In this manner all closed systems protect \\nthemselves at the same time from the refer- \\nential — as well as from all metalanguage that the \\nsystem forestalls in playing at its own meta- \\nlanguage; that is to say in duplicating itself in its \\nown critique of itself. In simulation, the meta- \\nlinguistic illusion duplicates and completes the \\nreferential illusion (pathetic hallucination of the \\nsign and pathetic hallucination of the real). \\n\\n\"It\\'s a circus,\" \"It\\'s theatre,\" \"It\\'s a movie,\" old \\nadages, old naturalistic denunciation. These \\nsayings are now obsolete. The problem now is \\n\\n\\n\\n148 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nthat of the saieUwithn of the rm\\\\, the putting into \\norbit of an indefinable reality without common \\nmeasure to the fantasies that once used to orna- \\nment it This satellization we find further natur- \\nalized in the two- rooms- kite hen shower that \\nthey have launched into orbit — to the powers of \\nspace, you could say — with the last lunar module. \\nThe banality of the earthly habitat lifted to the \\nrank\\'of cosmic value, of absolute decor — hypo- \\nstatized in space— this is the end of metaphysics, \\nthe era of hyperreality that begins. * But the \\nspatial transcendence of the banality of the two- \\nrooms, like its cool and mechanical figuration of \\nhyperrealism, * says only one thing: that this \\nmodule, such as it is, participates in a \\nhyperspace of representation — where each is \\nalready technically in possession of the instant- \\naneous reproduction of his own life, where the \\npilots of the Tupolev that crashed at Bourget \\ncould see themselves die live on their own \\ncamera. This is nothing else that the short- \\ncircuit of the response by the question in the \\ntest, instantaneous process of re-conduction \\nwhereby reality is immediately contaminated \\nby its simulacrum. \\n\\nThere used to be, before, a specific class of \\nallegorical and slightly diabolical objects: mir- \\n\\n\\n\\n149 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nrors, images, works of art (concepts?)— \\nsimulacra, but transparent and manifest (you \\ndidn\\'t confuse the counterfeit with theoriginal), \\nthat had their characteristic style and savoir- \\nfaire. And pleasure consisted then rather in \\ndiscovering the \"natural\" in what was artificial \\nand counterfeit. Today, when the real and the \\nimaginary are confused in the same operational \\ntotality, the esthetic fascination is everywhere. \\nIt is a subliminal perception (a sort of sixth \\nsense) of deception, montage, seen aria — of the \\noverexposed reality in the light of the models — \\nno longer a production space, but a reading \\nstrip, strip of coding and decoding, magnetized \\nby the signs— esthetic reality — no longer by the \\npremeditation and the distance of art, but by its \\nelevation to the second level, to the second \\npower, by the anticipation and the immanence \\nof the code. A kind of non-intentional parody \\nhovers over everything, of technical simulation, \\nof indefinable fame to which is attached an \\nesthetic pleasure, that very one of reading and \\nof the rules of the game. Travellingof signs, the \\nmedia, of fashion and the models, of the blind \\nand brilliant ambiance of the simulacra. \\n\\nA long time ago art prefigured this turning \\nwhich is that today of daily life. Very quickly the \\n\\n\\n\\n150 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\nwork turns back on itself as the manipulation of \\nthe signs of art: over- signification of art, \\n\"academism of the signifier,\" as Levi-Strauss \\nwould say, who interprets it really as the form- \\nsign. It* is then that art enters into its indefinite \\nreproduction: all that reduplicates itself, even if it \\nbe the everyday and banal reality, falls by the \\ntoken under the sign of art, and becomes \\nesthetic. It\\'s the same thing for production, \\nwhich you could say is entering today this \\nesthetic reduplication, this phase when, expel- \\nling all content and finality, it becomes \\nsomehow abstract and non- figurative. It ex- \\npresses then the pure form of production, it \\ntakes upon itself, as art, the value of a finality \\nwithout purpose. Art and industry can then \\nexchange their signs. Art can become a \\nreproducing machine (Andy Warhol), without \\nceasing to be art, since the machine is only a \\nsign. And production can lose all soda! finality \\nso as to be verified and exalted finally in the \\nprestigious, hyperbolic signs that are the great \\nindustrial combines, the \\'/i-mile-high towers or \\nthe number mysteries of the GNP. \\n\\nAnd so art is everywhere, since art if ice is at \\nthe very heart of reality. And so art is dead, not \\nonly because its critical transcendence is gone, \\n\\n\\n\\n151 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\nbut because reality itself, entirely impregnated \\nby an aesthetic which is inseparable from its \\nown structure, has been confused with its own \\nimage. Reality no longer has the time to take on \\nthe appearance of reality. It no longer even \\nsurpasses fiction: it captures every dream even \\nbefore it takes on the appearance of a dream. \\nSchizophrenic vertigo of these serial signs, for \\nwhich no counterfeit, no sublimation is possible, \\nimmanent in their repetition— who could say \\nwhat the reality is that these signs simulate? \\nThey no longer even repress anything (which is \\nwhy. if you will, simulation pushes us close to \\nthe sphere of psychosis). Even the primary \\nprocesses are abolished in them. The cool \\nuniverse of digitality has absorbed the world of \\nmetaphor and metonymy. The principle of \\nsimulation wins out over the reality principle \\njust as over the principle of pleasure. \\n\\nTranslated by Philip Beilchmcm \\n\\n\\n\\n152 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Orders of Simulacra \\n\\n\\n\\nNotes \\n\\n1- Counterfeit and reproduction imply always an \\nanguish, a disquieting foreign n ess: the uneasiness before \\nthe photograph, considered like a witches trick— and \\nmore generally before any technical apparatus, which is \\nalways an apparatus of reproduction, is related by \\nBenjamin to the uneasiness before the mirror- image. \\nThere is already sorcery at work in the mirror. But how \\nmuch more so when this image can be detached from the \\nmirror and be transported, stocked, reproduced at will < cf. \\nTk( Shiihit of Prague, where the devil detaches the image of \\nthe student from the mirror and hair asses him to death \\nby the intermediary of this image). All reproduction \\nimplies therefore a kind of black magic, from the fact of \\nbeing seduced by one\\'s own image in the water, like \\nNarcissus, to being haunted by the double and, who \\nknows, to the mortal turning back of this vast technical \\napparatus secreted today by man as his own image Uhe \\nnarcissistic mirage of \\'technique.

Reproduction is diabolical in its very essence; it \\nmakes something fundamental vacillate. This has hardly \\nchanged for us: simulation (that we describe here as the \\noperation of the code) is Still and always the place of a \\ngigantic enterprise of manipulation, of control and of \\ndeath, just like the imitative object (primitive statuette, \\nimage of photo) always had as objective an operation of \\nblack image. \\n\\n\\n\\n153 \\n\\n\\n\\nJean Baudrillard \\n\\n\\n\\n2. There is furthermore inMonodTs book a flagrant \\ncontradiction, which reflects the ambiguity of all current \\nscience. His discourse concerns the code, that is the third- \\norder simulacra, but it does so still according to\"sdentific\" \\nschemes of the second-order— objectiveness, \"scientific* \\nethic of knowledge, science\\'s principle of truth and \\ntranscendence. All things incompatible with the indeter- \\nminable models of the third- order. \\n\\n3. \"It\\'s the feeble definition\\' of TV which condemns \\nits spectator to rearranging the few points retained into a \\nkind of n&strart work.

The \\ncontents of knowledge (teaching) or of affective relations, \\nthe pedagogical or familial referent having been eliminat- \\ned in the act of emancipation, there remains only a \\ndemand linked to the empty form of the institution- \\nperverse demand, and for that reason all the more \\nobstinate- \"Transferable\" desire (that is to say non- \\nreferential, un- referential), desire that has been fed by \\ntack, by the- place left vacant \"liberated,\" desire captured \\nin its own vertiginous image, desire of desire, as pure \\nform, hyperreal.

But this was still interpreted as resistance, as \\ndetour, and did not put fundamentally into question \\neither the process of analysis or the principle of \\ntransference- It is another thing entirely when the \\nunconscious itself, the discourse of the unconscious \\nbecomes unh\\'ndable — according to the same scenario of \\nsimulative anticipation that we have seen at work on alt \\nlevels with the machines of the third order. The analysis \\nthen can no longer end, it becomes logically and \\nhistorically interminable, since it stabilizes on a puppet- \\nsubstance of reproduction, an unconscious programmed \\non demand— an impossible-tCHbreak-throughpoirvtaround \\nwhich the whole analysis is rearranged.
